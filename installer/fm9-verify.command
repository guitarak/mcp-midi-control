# MCP MIDI Control - FM9 WRITE-VERIFY probe (SAFE: never saves).
#
# Connects to a plugged-in FM9 over USB MIDI and runs each shipped write op
# (set a knob, set a model, place a block, switch scene, bypass) against the
# LOADED preset, reading each one back to confirm the device applied it. It
# NEVER saves, and it RELOADS your preset at the end to discard every change,
# so your FM9 ends exactly where it started. Quit FM9-Edit first so it isn't
# holding the MIDI port.
#
# Double-click in Finder, or run `bash fm9-verify.command` in Terminal.
# Hand the resulting JSON file back to the maintainer.
