rem MCP MIDI Control - FM9 WRITE-VERIFY probe (SAFE: never saves).
rem
rem Connects to a plugged-in FM9 over USB MIDI and runs each shipped write op
rem (set a knob, set a model, place a block, switch scene, bypass) against the
rem LOADED preset, reading each one back to confirm the device applied it. It
rem NEVER saves, and it RELOADS your preset at the end to discard every change,
rem so your FM9 ends exactly where it started. Quit FM9-Edit first so it isn't
rem holding the MIDI port.
rem
rem Hand the resulting JSON file back to the maintainer.
