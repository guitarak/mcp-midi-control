# Fractal Preset Schema: shipped contract

**Status: shipped.** v0.1 contract (2026-05-11) + v0.4 routing
extensions (2026-05-14). The runtime types live in
`packages/core/src/protocol-generic/types.ts:PresetSpec` and the
device-level translations in each device's descriptor under
`packages/<device>/src/descriptor/`. Hardware-verified end-to-end on
AM4 + Axe-Fx II XL+ (live launch-verify 24/24); cross-row cabling
audited via golden + audition test against live Axe-Fx II.

This document is the canonical reference for "a Fractal preset": one
shape that covers every Fractal guitar processor:

- **AM4** (linear, 4 slots, A/B/C/D channels, 4 scenes): shipped
- **Axe-Fx II / II XL / II XL+** (4×12 grid, X/Y channels, 8 scenes): shipped
- **Axe-Fx III** (4×14 grid, A/B/C/D channels, 8 scenes): schema-ready; descriptor pending (community beta)
- **FM9** (4×14 grid, A/B/C/D channels, 8 scenes): schema-ready; descriptor pending
- **FM3** (4×4 grid, A/B/C/D channels, 8 scenes): schema-ready; descriptor pending

Hydrasynth and other non-Fractal devices are **out of scope**: their
domain model differs enough (NRPN modulation matrix, patch-based
architecture, no scenes) that forcing them into a Fractal shape would
hurt more than it helps. They stay on the generic `PresetSpec` already
shipped, with their own descriptor-level translation.

## Why this matters

The founder's framing: "the integration API IS the schema."

Today, the unified `apply_preset` accepts a single `PresetSpec` shape
that's the lowest common denominator across AM4 + grid devices. It
works for v0.1 linear-row-2 chains. But the eventual goal (parallel
chains, FX loops, stereo splits, the full grid editing experience
AxeEdit ships) requires expressing topology richer than "slots in
order."

This schema is the design choice that unlocks Level 4 routing
(parallel paths, multi-row merges) while keeping AM4 callers
unchanged.

---

## Domain model: six axes

Every Fractal preset varies along these six axes:

| Axis | What it is | AM4 | Axe-Fx II | Axe-Fx III / FM9 / FM3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Block placement** | Where each block sits in the signal path | 4 fixed slots | 48 cells (4×12) | 56 to 64 cells (4×14 to 4×16) |
| **Block instances** | Multiple of the same type per preset? | No (1 per type) | Yes (Amp 1, Amp 2, …) | Yes |
| **Channels** | Per-block parameter variations | 4 letters (A/B/C/D) | 2 letters (X/Y) | 4 letters (A/B/C/D) |
| **Routing** | Signal flow between blocks | Implicit linear | Explicit per-cell input mask | Explicit per-cell input mask |
| **Scenes** | Performance snapshots picking channels + bypass | 4 scenes | 8 scenes | 8 scenes |
| **Metadata** | Preset name, scene names | 32-char ASCII | 32-char ASCII | 32-char ASCII |

The schema needs to accommodate every axis without inflating the
linear case beyond what it actually needs.

 * devices ignore the routing array; etc.).

## How it translates per device

### AM4 (linear)

A 4-block clean preset:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Clean Vox",
  "blocks": [
    { "block_type": "compressor", "slot": 1 },
    { "block_type": "amp",        "slot": 2,
      "params": { "type": "Class-A 30W TB", "gain": 4, "master": 6, "treble": 7 } },
    { "block_type": "cab",        "slot": 3 },
    { "block_type": "reverb",     "slot": 4,
      "params": { "type": "Spring, Medium", "mix": 25 } }
  ],
  "scenes": [
    { "index": 1, "channels": { "amp": "A" }, "bypassed": { "compressor": false } },
    { "index": 2, "channels": { "amp": "B" }, "bypassed": { "compressor": true } }
  ],
  "landing_scene": 1
}
```

AM4 descriptor:
- Reads each block's `slot: 1..4` as the linear position
- Ignores `instance` (errors if anything but 1)
- Ignores `routing` if present (linear is implicit)
- Walks `scenes[]` and writes per-scene channel + bypass via the
  switch-write-switch-back pattern
- `params: { gain: 5 }` → flat map; writes to the currently-active
  channel on channel blocks (or the sole register on non-channel
  blocks). `params_by_channel: { A: {gain:5}, B: {gain:8} }` is the
  multi-channel form (shipped 2026-05-21): the writer walks each channel

### Axe-Fx II (grid, row-2 linear chain, Level 1)

Same preset, expressed for Axe-Fx II:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Clean Vox",
  "blocks": [
    { "block_type": "compressor", "slot": 1 },
    { "block_type": "amp",        "slot": 2,
      "params": { "X": { "input_drive": 4, "master_volume": 6, "treble": 7 } } },
    { "block_type": "cab",        "slot": 3 },
    { "block_type": "reverb",     "slot": 4,
      "params": { "X": { "type": "Spring, Medium", "mix": 25 } } }
  ],
  "scenes": [
    { "index": 1, "channels": { "amp": "X" } },
    { "index": 2, "channels": { "amp": "Y" } }
  ],
  "landing_scene": 1
}
```

Axe-Fx II descriptor:
- Reads `slot: number` as shorthand for `{ row: 2, col: number }`
- Auto-extends with shunts on cols N+1..12, auto-cables row 2
- No `routing` array → linear row-2 chain inferred
- Channel letters X/Y validated; A/B rejected

### Axe-Fx II: parallel chain (Level 4)

A wet/dry split: comp → splits to dry path AND wet path with delay+reverb, then merges:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Wet/Dry Lead",
  "blocks": [
    { "id": "comp",   "block_type": "compressor", "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 1 } },
    { "id": "amp",    "block_type": "amp",        "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 2 },
      "params": { "X": { "input_drive": 7, "master_volume": 5 } } },
    { "id": "cab",    "block_type": "cab",        "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 3 } },
    { "id": "delay",  "block_type": "delay",      "slot": { "row": 1, "col": 4 },
      "params": { "X": { "mix": 100, "time": 350 } } },
    { "id": "reverb", "block_type": "reverb",     "slot": { "row": 3, "col": 4 },
      "params": { "X": { "mix": 100 } } },
    { "id": "mixer",  "block_type": "mixer",      "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 5 } }
  ],
  "routing": [
    { "from": "comp",  "to": "amp" },
    { "from": "amp",   "to": "cab" },
    { "from": "cab",   "to": "delay" },
    { "from": "cab",   "to": "reverb" },
    { "from": "cab",   "to": "mixer" },
    { "from": "delay", "to": "mixer" },
    { "from": "reverb","to": "mixer" }
  ]
}
```

The descriptor:
- Places each block at its explicit `{ row, col }`
- For each `routing` edge, derives the dst cell's input mask by
  OR-ing bits for each src row that feeds it
- Sends one `fn 0x06 SET_CELL_ROUTING` per edge
- The `mixer` block ends up with `routing_mask = 0x05` (bits 0 + 2,
  receives from rows 1 and 3 of prev col) → merges the three sources

### Axe-Fx III (when added)

Same schema as Axe-Fx II, just with:
- 4 channels A/B/C/D instead of X/Y
- 4×14 grid instead of 4×12
- Different block-type catalog (more block groups, different effectId space)

All of this is descriptor concerns; the schema doesn't change.

---

## What this replaces / extends

**Current shape (`src/protocol/generic/types.ts:PresetSpec`):**

```typescript
interface PresetSpec {
  slots: Array<{ slot: SlotRef; block_type: string; params?: ...; bypassed?: boolean; }>;
  scenes?: Array<{ scene: number; channels?: ...; bypassed?: ...; name?: string; }>;
  landingScene?: number;
  name?: string;
}
```

**The gaps:**

1. **No `instance` field**: can't address `Amp 2` distinctly from `Amp 1`.
2. **No `routing` array**: grid devices can only do row-2 linear chains.
3. **No block `id`**: scenes reference blocks by `block_type` string,
   which collides on multi-instance presets.
4. **No `routing` semantics for cross-row cables**: parallel chains,
   FX loops, stereo splits all blocked.

**Migration plan:**

- Add `instance?: number`, `id?: string` to slot/block entries.
- Add `routing?: RoutingEdge[]` at top level.
- Use block `id` (or auto-derived from `block_type + instance`) in
  scene maps. Back-compat: existing scenes that use `block_type` slug
  keys (e.g. `bypassed: { drive: true }`) continue working when there's
  only one instance; the descriptor falls back to slug lookup.
- Rename `slots` → `blocks` (conceptually clearer, `slot` is the
  POSITION, not the thing). Keep `slots` as a back-compat alias for
  one release cycle. Same for `scenes[].scene` → `scenes[].index`.

The changes are additive at the type level. Existing AM4 + Axe-Fx II
linear callers (slot 608, 609, all prior tests) continue working
unchanged.

---

## Why the founder's instinct is right

> "this is what the integration API actually is."

A few reasons this design IS the API:

1. **It's the contract the LLM sees.** Tool descriptions paste this
   shape into the agent's context window. The shape's clarity
   directly determines whether the agent picks the right blocks /
   slots / channels / scenes when building a preset from natural
   language.

2. **It's the contract that propagates to every device.** Adding
   FM9 or Axe-Fx III is a descriptor that accepts FractalPreset and
   translates to device-native ops. The schema doesn't change per
   device; only the descriptor's wire layer does.

3. **It's the contract files / setlists / version-controlled tone
   libraries use.** A YAML / JSON file of FractalPreset shapes IS
   the user's tone library. They can commit it to git, share it,
   export it to AxeEdit-compatible format, anything.

4. **It's the contract that survives the wire-protocol decoding.**
   Wire protocols change between firmware revisions (Q8.02 → Quantum
   10.0, different SysEx envelopes). The schema is firmware-
   independent; per-device descriptors absorb the wire churn.

A well-designed FractalPreset shape is the senior-engineering moat:
new devices = new descriptors, not new tools. New routing topologies
= same shape, descriptor handles. New firmware = wire-layer fix,
schema unchanged.

---

## Open questions

1. **Do we expose a higher-level `chain: BlockRef[]` shorthand for
   the common linear case?** Pro: ergonomic for AM4 + Level 1 Axe-Fx
   II users. Con: two ways to do the same thing. Recommended: NO,
   the descriptor's automatic linear-chain inference (when `routing`
   omitted) is enough.

2. **How does flat `params` interact with multi-channel devices?**
   AM4's "active channel" is whatever the user last selected on the
   device. If a caller passes flat `params: { gain: 5 }` without
   specifying channel, the descriptor writes to whatever's active,
   which may not be what the caller intended. When the caller needs
   a specific channel, pass `params_by_channel: { A: { gain: 5 } }`
   instead. The split (2026-05-21) made the two fields distinct so
   the shape is unambiguous at the schema layer.

3. **Should `routing` be allowed on linear devices?** If a caller
   accidentally passes `routing` to AM4, do we error or silently
   ignore? Recommended: error with a clear message ("routing edges
   are not applicable on linear devices; AM4 routes implicitly by
   slot order"). Silent ignore hides bugs.

4. **Scene-name writes on Axe-Fx II.** Currently undecoded. The
   schema accepts `scenes[].name`; the descriptor throws
   `capability_not_supported` when called against a device that
   can't write scene names. Recommended: schema accepts it
   universally; descriptor surfaces the error.

5. **Multi-block-type aliases.** AM4's "GEQ" vs "Graphic EQ", same
   thing, different names. Resolved at the descriptor's
   `block_aliases` map. Schema is canonical; descriptor handles
   spelling.

---

## What this enables in v0.4

With FractalPreset shipped:

- **Parallel chains** (wet/dry, doubled drives merging at a mixer)
- **FX loops** (send on row 1, return on row 3)
- **Stereo splits** (L on row 1, R on row 3, merge at OUTPUT)
- **Multi-amp presets** (Amp 1 on row 2 col 4, Amp 2 on row 4 col 4,
  blended at a mixer)
- **Setlist files as version-controlled YAML** (one shape across all
  Fractal gear; portable between AM4 and Axe-Fx II for compatible
  blocks)
- **Authoring tools that round-trip** (export AxeEdit preset →
  FractalPreset → reimport)

---

## Shipped: implementation milestones

All milestones below shipped through 2026-05-14:

1. ✅ `PresetSpec` extended with `instance`, `id`, `routing` fields
   (back-compat preserved). Lives in
   `packages/core/src/protocol-generic/types.ts:265-363`.
2. ✅ Descriptor translators wired for AM4 + Axe-Fx II XL+. AM4 rejects
   `routing[]` + `instance≠1` (linear device contract); Axe-Fx II
   accepts both and walks the routing edges.
3. ✅ `routing` walk in `applyExecutor`
   (`packages/axe-fx-ii/src/tools/applyExecutor.ts:414-490`). Validates
   adjacent-column constraint + block-id references before any wire
   write fires.
4. ✅ Shunt synthesis (routing follow-on):
   `block_type: "shunt"` (or numeric id 200..235) resolves to a
   synthetic block with a unique id per occurrence. Required for
   audible wet/dry presets that reach the OUTPUT terminator at col 12.
5. ✅ Unit golden: `scripts/verify-axe-fx-ii-routing.ts` (5 cases:
   wet/dry parallel, legacy linear, adjacent-column rejection,
   unknown block id rejection, shunt synthesis). Wired into
   `npm test`.
6. ✅ Hardware audition: `launch-verify` exercises a wet/dry split
   end-to-end through `StdioClientTransport` → dispatcher → descriptor
   → wire → device acks. Same wire path Claude Desktop uses.

**Hardware sign-off remaining (founder, manual):** save the wet/dry +
shunts spec from the README to a slot on a live Axe-Fx II and audibly
confirm parallel routing produces a wider stereo image than series
routing of the same blocks.

## Per-device capability adaptation

Each device's `DeviceDescriptor` declares which schema fields it
accepts. The dispatcher consults the descriptor's capability flags
to refuse unsupported combinations BEFORE any wire write fires, with
structured error codes (`routing_not_supported`,
`capability_not_supported`, `instance_not_supported`).

| Field | AM4 | Axe-Fx II XL+ | Axe-Fx III (planned) | FM3 / FM9 (planned) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `slots[].slot` accepts | `1..4` integer | `1..12` int OR `{row, col}` | `{row, col}` 4×14 | 4×4 / 4×14 grid |
| Channels | `A`/`B`/`C`/`D` | `X`/`Y` only | `A`/`B`/`C`/`D` | `A`/`B`/`C`/`D` |
| `scenes[]` count | 1..4 | 1..8 | 1..8 | 1..8 |
| `routing[]` | **rejected** | accepted | will accept | will accept |
| `instance` | only `1` | `1..N` | `1..N` | `1..N` |
| `block_type: "shunt"` | n/a | accepted (post v0.4) | will accept | will accept |
| `landingScene` | scene 1..4 | scene 1..8 | scene 1..8 | scene 1..8 |

When a new Fractal device gets a descriptor, its capability flags get
filled in here and the schema "just works": zero new MCP tools, zero
schema changes.

## Appendix: `fill_to_output` proposal (post-v0.4)

**Status:** sketch. Pre-implementation; expect iteration before code.

### Problem

The Axe-Fx II OUTPUT terminator pulls from col 12 of the routing grid.
Signal that doesn't reach a cabled cell on row 2 col 12 is silent. The
legacy row-2 auto-chain mode handles this implicitly: it places
shunts at every empty row-2 col after the last content block and
cables them to col 12.

v0.4 explicit-routing mode SKIPS all of that on the principle "the
caller supplied the routing, trust it verbatim." That's correct for
fully-specified topologies, but it makes the common wet/dry case
verbose. A two-row wet/dry split with the merge at col 5 needs:

```jsonc
{
  "slots": [
    { "id": "comp",     "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 1 }, "block_type": "compressor" },
    { "id": "delay",    "slot": { "row": 1, "col": 2 }, "block_type": "delay" },
    { "id": "reverb",   "slot": { "row": 1, "col": 3 }, "block_type": "reverb" },
    { "id": "mixer",    "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 4 }, "block_type": "mixer" },
    // 7 more "shunt" entries needed at row 2 cols 5..11 to reach col 12.
    // Each shunt is also a "block_type" placement (shunt is its own block type),
    // and each adjacent pair needs a routing edge below.
    { "id": "shunt_5",  "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 5 },  "block_type": "shunt" },

    // shunts too (comp → R2C2 shunt → R2C3 shunt → mixer). The wet/dry
    // example doesn't fit cleanly without ALSO filling dry-path shunts.

    { "from": "shunt_6",  "to": "shunt_7" },
    { "from": "shunt_7",  "to": "shunt_8" },
    { "from": "shunt_8",  "to": "shunt_9" },
    { "from": "shunt_9",  "to": "shunt_10" },
    { "from": "shunt_10", "to": "shunt_11" },
    { "from": "shunt_11", "to": "shunt_12" },
    { "from": "mixer",    "to": "shunt_5" }
  ]
}
```

The 8 shunt entries + 8 routing edges (the entire bottom half of the
spec) carry no creative intent; they're the cost of "getting signal
to OUTPUT." An LLM authoring this is more likely to forget a shunt
than to get the topology wrong, and the resulting silent preset
looks identical to a real audio failure.

### Proposed API

Add an optional boolean to `PresetSpec`:

```ts
interface PresetSpec {
  // ... existing fields ...
  routing?: readonly RoutingEdge[];

  /**
   * v0.4+: grid devices only. When true AND routing[] is supplied,
   * the executor auto-extends row 2 from the rightmost-occupied row-2
   * cell to col 12 by placing shunt blocks in every empty intermediate
   * cell and cabling them in sequence. Linear devices (AM4) reject
   * this field with a capability error; they route implicitly.
   *
   * No-op when routing[] is omitted (legacy auto-chain mode already
   * extends to OUTPUT) or when the rightmost row-2 cell is already col 12.
   *
   * Default: false (opt-in, preserves explicit-mode "trust the caller
   * verbatim" semantics for fully-specified topologies).
   */
  fill_to_output?: boolean;
}
```

With `fill_to_output: true`, the wet/dry spec above collapses to:

```jsonc
{
  "slots": [
    { "id": "comp",   "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 1 }, "block_type": "compressor" },
    { "id": "delay",  "slot": { "row": 1, "col": 2 }, "block_type": "delay" },
    { "id": "reverb", "slot": { "row": 1, "col": 3 }, "block_type": "reverb" },
    { "id": "mixer",  "slot": { "row": 2, "col": 4 }, "block_type": "mixer" }
  ],
  "routing": [
    { "from": "comp",   "to": "delay" },
    { "from": "delay",  "to": "reverb" },
    { "from": "reverb", "to": "mixer" },
    { "from": "comp",   "to": "mixer" }    // ← still flagged: not adjacent (R2C1 → R2C4)
  ],
  "fill_to_output": true
}
```

The dry path R2C1 → R2C4 is still adjacency-invalid (cols 1 and 4
aren't adjacent), so the user still needs to either:
  a) Put a shunt at R2C2 and R2C3, cable comp→R2C2→R2C3→mixer
  b) Or accept that one of "wet path runs cols 2-3" or "dry path runs
     cols 2 to 3" needs intermediate shunts; they share row 2

This is a real topological constraint, not a verbosity problem.
`fill_to_output` only solves the post-merge tail (`mixer → OUTPUT`),
which is genuinely mechanical.

### Behavior: what the executor does

After the explicit-routing edge loop (current behavior), if
`fill_to_output: true`:

1. Find the rightmost row-2 column occupied by any block in `resolved`.
   Call it `lastRow2Col`. If no row-2 blocks at all, raise an error
   ("`fill_to_output` requires at least one row-2 block to extend
   from; your topology has no row-2 anchor"). Don't silently no-op.

2. If `lastRow2Col >= 12`, skip (the chain already terminates at the
   OUTPUT column).

3. For each col in `lastRow2Col + 1` .. `12`:
   a. Allocate a unique shunt block id (extend the SHUNT_BASE_ID=200
      counter past any explicit shunts already in `resolved`).
   b. Emit `set_grid_cell({ row: 2, col, blockId })` (SHUNT placement).
   c. Emit `set_cell_routing({ srcRow: 2, srcCol: col-1, dstRow: 2,
      dstCol: col, connect: true })` (cable previous cell to this one).

   The cable at `col = lastRow2Col + 1` connects the user's last block
   to the first auto-shunt; everything from there to col 12 is the
   auto-fill chain.

4. Append all the auto-fill ops to the same `ops[]` array the
   explicit-routing loop populates, so they hit the wire in the same
   single-pass place-then-cable order the existing flow uses.

### Safety / failure modes

- **Unmixed parallel paths**. If the user has row-1 blocks at cols
  past `lastRow2Col` (a wet path that didn't merge), those signals
  don't reach OUTPUT. `fill_to_output` shouldn't try to fix this;
  it only extends row 2. Optional follow-up: emit a warning in the
  apply_preset response: `"fill_to_output extended row 2 to col 12,
  but row 1 has blocks past your row-2 endpoint that aren't cabled
  to a mixer, those signals won't reach OUTPUT."`

- **Block-id collisions**. Auto-fill shunts must use ids that don't
  conflict with explicit blocks. Scan `resolved` for existing shunt
  ids in the 200..235 range, allocate next-available.

- **Cross-device contract**. AM4 must reject `fill_to_output: true`
  in the same capability-not-supported branch that already rejects
  `routing[]`. Hydrasynth's apply_preset path doesn't reach this
  code, but the dispatcher should validate at the boundary so the
  error is consistent across grid vs non-grid devices.

- **Interaction with `routing[]` omitted**. `fill_to_output` is
  meaningless without explicit routing; the legacy auto-chain mode
  already extends to OUTPUT. Decision: silently ignore (no error)
  when routing[] is omitted, on the grounds that the user's intent is
  satisfied either way. Document this in the field's description.

### Implementation effort

~1-2 hours including:
  - PresetSpec type extension (1 line)
  - Zod schema entry on `presetShape` with description (5 lines)
  - AM4 writer specToApplyInput rejection (5 lines, mirrors routing[] rejection)
  - Axe-Fx II applyExecutor auto-fill loop after the explicit-routing
    edge loop (~30 lines)
  - 1 golden in verify-transpile covering: explicit routing topology
    that stops at col 5 with `fill_to_output: true` → 7 auto-shunts +
    8 auto-cables appended to the op stream
  - Optional: warning when unmixed paths detected

Hardware verification once it lands:
  - `scripts/mcp-hwtest-wet-dry.ts` (was task #16). With
    `fill_to_output: true`, the wet/dry spec is ~10 lines instead of ~30.
  - `scripts/mcp-hwtest-dual-amp.ts` (was task #16). Dual amp at R2C4
    + R4C4 merging at a mixer at R2C5; `fill_to_output` extends R2
    cols 6..12.

### Open questions for review

1. **Field name.** `fill_to_output` is explicit but verbose. Alternatives:
   `auto_extend_to_output`, `terminate_at_output`, `auto_shunt_tail`. The
   verbose name is preferable because it appears in user-facing tool
   responses ("Auto-extended row 2 with 7 shunts via fill_to_output.").

2. **Default true vs false?** Currently proposing default false.
   Argument for default true: most users want their preset to make
   sound, the few cases where they explicitly want row 2 truncated
   are rare. Argument for default false: explicit-routing mode is
   already opt-in (you only get there by passing `routing[]`); adding
   implicit shunt-fill on top muddies the contract. Lean: false.

3. **Should the auto-fill emit a `warnings[]` entry in the
   apply_preset response listing which cells were auto-filled?** Yes,
   same pattern as `apply_preset.warning` for type-gated skip+warn.
   Lets the agent narrate the action honestly ("Filled row 2 cols
   6 to 12 with shunts to reach OUTPUT").
