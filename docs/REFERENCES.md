## Per-device authoritative decode status (read first)

Before opening a new reverse-engineering investigation or proposing a
protocol change, consult these; they reflect what is currently
byte-verified vs. what is still open. Always more current than the
manuals.

- **`docs/research/fractal-protocol-decode-status.md`**: cross-device status
  index (AM4 / Axe-Fx II / Axe-Fx III). Tells you which paramId
  families are named and which are still open per device.
- **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/am4/SYSEX-MAP.md`**: AM4 wire
  map, byte-exact, with capture references for every confirmed claim.
- **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-ii/SYSEX-MAP.md`**:
  Axe-Fx II wire map.
- **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-iii/SYSEX-MAP.md`**:
  Axe-Fx III wire map (covers Fractal's v1.4 PDF + community RE).
- **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/hydrasynth/SYSEX-MAP.md`**:
  Hydrasynth wire map.
- **`docs/research/ghidra-mining-workflow.md`**: proven canonical RE method
  for paramId catalog extraction (99% wire-accuracy verified). Read
  before opening a new Ghidra project on any Fractal editor binary.

## Official Fractal Audio documents (local)

Cross-device Fractal documents live in `docs/manuals/`. Per-device
manuals (AM4, Axe-Fx II, Axe-Fx III, Hydrasynth) live under
`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/<device>/manuals/` (in the codec
package). Plain-text `.txt` extractions sit next to each PDF for
grep-ability.

### `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/am4/manuals/AM4-Owners-Manual.pdf` (8.4 MB, extracted to `.txt`, 2956 lines)
Primary AM4 user manual from Fractal Audio. The authoritative source for:
- Hardware controls, footswitch functions, rear-panel I/O.
- Preset navigation model (A1 to Z4, scenes, channels).
- Per-block parameter names as shown on the AM4 display; treat as **ground truth**
  for block-TYPE names and parameter labels when writing presets.
- Global setup menu (I/O, MIDI channel, noise gate, etc.).

### `docs/manuals/Fractal-Audio-Blocks-Guide.pdf` (3.7 MB, extracted to `.txt`, 4745 lines)
Deep per-block parameter reference covering the entire current Fractal product line
(Axe-Fx III / FM9 / FM3 / AM4 / VP4). Use when the AM4 owner's manual is too terse.
Contains:
- Full parameter lists for every effect block TYPE (e.g., every Delay type, every
  Reverb type) with parameter ranges and units.
- Channel/modifier/controller architecture.
- Is the correct source for "what does parameter X do" once you know the TYPE.

### `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-iii/manuals/Axe-Fx-III-MIDI-for-3rd-Party-Devices.pdf` (220 KB, extracted to `Axe-Fx-III-MIDI-for-3rd-Party-Devices.txt`)
The only public SysEx protocol document from Fractal. AM4 is in the same family,
so this defines the "baseline" command set (bypass 0x0A, channel 0x0B, scene 0x0C,
patch/scene name query 0x0D/0x0E, status dump 0x13, tempo 0x14). **AM4 has been
empirically confirmed to follow this spec** (2026-04-14) with AM4-specific
extensions above block ID 200 and an internal editor-streaming function `0x01`
not documented here. See `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/am4/SYSEX-MAP.md` for the AM4-resolved mapping.

### `samples/factory/README AM4+VP4 Presets Update Guide.pdf` (extracted alongside)
Short guide on using **Fractal-Bot** (the librarian built into AM4-Edit) to push
`.syx` files to the device. Confirms that `.syx` files are literal SysEx byte
streams (the same bytes sent over USB MIDI during upload) and that AM4/VP4
banks are handled differently from Axe-Fx III family banks.

### `samples/factory/AM4-Factory-Presets-1p01.syx` (1.28 MB)
Full AM4 factory preset bank as distributed by Fractal. Contains all 104 slots
worth of presets in a single `.syx` dump. Can be parsed the same way as
individual exports (header `0x77` / chunks `0x78` / footer `0x79`), multiplied
by the number of presets.

## Other-manufacturer manuals (local)

Docs for devices on the multi-device expansion roadmap (Axe-Fx II,
Axe-Fx III, FM3, FM9, VP4).
Per-device manuals live under
`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/<device>/manuals/` (in the codec
package); cross-device docs (Blocks Guide, MIMIC whitepaper) live in
`docs/manuals/`. **PDFs are gitignored** for copyright and size
reasons; only the plain-text extractions are committed.
If you need the source PDF, obtain it from the manufacturer's downloads
page. Extract with `pdftotext -layout <file>.pdf <file>.txt` (ships with
Git for Windows).

### Fractal Audio: Axe-Fx II XL+
Manuals added 2026-05-09, live at
`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-ii/manuals/` (in the codec
package; the cross-device MIMIC whitepaper still lives at
`docs/manuals/`):
- `Axe-Fx-II-Owners-Manual.{pdf,txt}`: primary user manual. Section
  17.3 has the MIDI Implementation Chart; Section 16.19 documents the
  read-only `SysEx ID = 00 01 74` constraint and per-device-byte
  defaults. Q7.0 firmware-era doc.
- `Axe-Fx-II-Scenes-Mini-Manual-1.02.{pdf,txt}`: confirms 8-scene
  capability count.
- `Axe-Fx-II-Tone-Match-Manual.{pdf,txt}`: Tone Match block (block
  ID 170 per the wiki).
- `Axe-Fx-II-ir-capture.{pdf,txt}`: IR capture / cab capture
  procedure. Adjacent to `MIDI_START_IR_DOWNLOAD` (function 0x7A) and
  related MIDI flow.
- `Axe-Fx_II_XL_MIDI_THRU_Guide.{pdf,txt}`: XL/XL+ MIDI THRU jack
  routing rules.
- `Fractal-Audio-Systems-MIMIC-(tm)-Technology.{pdf,txt}`:
  cab-modeling whitepaper.
- **No dedicated Axe-Fx II SysEx implementation chart published.**
  Fractal didn't release one for the II line (only the III+ family
  got `Axe-Fx-III-MIDI-for-3rd-Party-Devices.pdf`). For Axe-Fx II
  protocol, the canonical source is the wiki MIDI_SysEx page below.

### Fractal factory bank exports (founder hardware)
Live at `samples/factory/` (gitignored). Captured from an Axe-Fx II XL+
at firmware Quantum 8.02:
- `Axe-Fx-II_XL+_Bank-{A,B,C}_Q8p02.syx`: 1.6 MB each, 128 presets
  per bank. Wire-confirm model byte `0x07`, envelope
  `00 01 74`, XOR-and-0x7F checksum, and the 1+64+1 message-per-preset
  shape (vs AM4's 1+4+1). See
  `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-ii/SYSEX-MAP.md` §6.
- `Axe-Fx-II-XL+_All-Banks_Q8p02.syx`: all three banks concatenated
  (4.8 MB).

### Tier 2 Roland / Boss devices (parked)

The roadmap names a future Tier 2 of Roland / Boss devices (RC-505 MKII,
VE-500, SPD-SX, JD-Xi). Manuals for those devices were once cached
locally but were dropped when the focus narrowed to the Tier 1
Fractal + Hydrasynth surface. Re-add the relevant manual `.txt`
extracts if any of those device decodes activate.
See [`docs/MULTI-DEVICE-ROADMAP.md`](MULTI-DEVICE-ROADMAP.md) Tier 2
for source URLs and per-device scope notes.

## Community sources (online, not local)

### Fractal Audio Wiki: `https://wiki.fractalaudio.com/wiki/index.php`
Scraped copy lives in `docs/wiki/` (gitignored; regenerate via
`npm run scrape-wiki -- P0` for block params, `P1` for protocol pages).
- `MIDI_SysEx` page: main source. Documents the COMPLETE Axe-Fx II /
  AX8 SysEx surface (function IDs 0x01..0x7C, per-block parameter ID
  tables for every block group, modifier semantics, IR-load protocol,
  preset numbering for XL/XL+ ranges 0..767). For AM4 the same page
  documents only the 5 mode-switch commands (function 0x12).
- Block pages (`Amp_block.md`, `Delay_block.md`, etc.): community parameter
  notes, often matching the Blocks Guide PDF.

### Fractal Audio Gen1 Wiki: `https://wiki.fractalaudio.com/gen1/index.php`
**Separate MediaWiki instance** for original Axe-Fx Standard / Ultra
(model bytes 0x00 / 0x01), direct ancestors to the Axe-Fx II family.
Useful for understanding the function-ID space evolution and the
8-bit-vs-16-bit parameter-value migration. Not covered by the existing
`scrape-wiki.ts` which targets `wiki.fractalaudio.com/wiki/` only.
- `Axe-Fx_SysEx_Documentation` page: Standard / Ultra protocol spec.
  The wiki disclaims SysEx info is "printed here with
  the permission of Fractal Audio", an authoritative source.

### Fractal Audio Forum: `https://forum.fractalaudio.com`
Active community. Useful search terms:
- "AM4 sysex": user experiments and findings.
- "preset format": reverse-engineering discussions (mostly Axe-Fx III, some apply).
- "3rd party MIDI": expected usage and gotchas.

### Axe-Fx II community libraries
A detailed scan of the open-source community RE projects, with license,
staleness, and coverage notes, lives in
**`packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/axe-fx-ii/community-re-methodology.md`**
(in the codec package). That doc is the canonical inventory; don't
duplicate the per-library breakdown here.

### Axe-Fx III preset-format reverse-engineering
Community projects that have partially reverse-engineered the Axe-Fx III preset
binary are potential cross-references for AM4 (same family, similar format):
- Not formally indexed here; search `github.com` for `axefx3` / `fractal preset parser`.
- Fractal Forum thread #159885 on `forum.fractalaudio.com`.

## Our own generated references

### `docs/BLOCK-PARAMS.md`
Committed working reference for AM4 block types and their available effect TYPEs.
Distilled from the wiki scrape + AM4 owner's manual. First stop when building a
preset IR.

### `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/<device>/SYSEX-MAP.md`
Working SysEx protocol reference, one file per device (in the codec
package). Updated after every sniff/probe session. First stop when
encoding a message to send.

### `packages/core/src/fractal-shared/lineage/*-lineage.json`
Model lineage dictionaries generated from the wiki scrape + Blocks Guide PDF
by `scripts/extract-lineage.ts` and `scripts/extract-axe-fx-ii-lineage.ts`.
One file per block (amp/drive/reverb/delay/cab/chorus/flanger/phaser/wah/
compressor) for AM4, plus `axefx2-*-lineage.json` for Axe-Fx II. Each record
carries the device-canonical name (e.g. `am4Name`), `inspiredBy` (with
`source` tag), `description`, `fractalQuotes`, and block-specific metadata
(family/powerTubes/matchingDynaCab for amps; categories/clipTypes for
drives; creator prefix for cabs). Re-run via `npm run extract-lineage` /
`npm run extract-axe-fx-ii-lineage` (or `npm run regen` for the full set)
whenever the wiki scrape is refreshed. The build also copies these files
into `packages/core/dist/fractal-shared/lineage/` via
`scripts/copy-build-assets.ts`.

Provenance policy: only Fractal-authored content is captured (Blocks Guide
entries, wiki parentheticals, forum quotes attributed `[Fractal Audio]`).
Brand-authored quotes (Xotic, JHS, Macari's) and community-inferred
qualitative tags (genre, era, mood adjectives) are deliberately omitted to
avoid hallucination risk; any record without a Fractal source has its
field populated via `flags: ['VERIFY: ...']` and no `inspiredBy`.

## How to use this file

- Before searching the web, check whether a local manual covers the question:
  `grep -l <term> docs/manuals/*.txt packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/*/manuals/*.txt`
  is fast and precise.
- When adding a new PDF or external reference to the project, add a section to
  this file so future Claude Code sessions discover it without rescanning.
- Prefer the AM4 owner's manual over the Blocks Guide when they disagree on
  AM4-specific behavior; the Blocks Guide covers the whole product line and
  may describe features not present on AM4.
