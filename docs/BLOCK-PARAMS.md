This document is the authoritative list of block types and effect-type names
usable when building AM4 presets. Type names are transcribed verbatim from the
Fractal wiki; anything marked `[FLAG: VERIFY]` is an ambiguity or gap that
needs confirmation against the AM4 owner's manual or a sniffed preset before
use in production code.

## Block ↔ catalog family quick reference

The Ghidra catalog (see SYSEX-MAP.md §6p) groups params by "effect family"
(Fractal's internal naming). Mapping for AM4's placeable blocks plus the
two non-placeable system blocks:

| Block | pidLow | Catalog family | Catalog case | Catalog params |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| amp | `0x003a` | DISTORT | 0xa | 143 (shared with drive) |
| drive | `0x0076` | DISTORT | 0xa | 143 (shared with amp) |
| cab | `0x003e` | CABINET | 0xb | 85 |
| reverb | `0x0042` | REVERB | 0xc | 63 |
| delay | `0x0046` | DELAY | 0xd | 80 |
| chorus | `0x004e` | CHORUS | 0x10 | 22 |
| flanger | `0x0052` | FLANGER | 0x11 | 26 |
| rotary | `0x0056` | ROTARY | 0x12 | 14 |
| phaser | `0x005a` | PHASER | 0x13 | 28 |
| wah | `0x005e` | WAH | 0x14 | 20 |
| tremolo | `0x006a` | TREMOLO | 0x16 | 15 |
| filter | `0x0072` | FILTER | 0x18 | 31 |
| enhancer | `0x007a` | ENHANCER | 0x1a | 8 |
| gate | `0x0092` | GATE | 0x23 | 13 |
| volpan | `0x0066` | VOLUME | 0x28 | 11 |
| geq | `0x0032` | GEQ | 0x8 | 13 |
| peq | `0x0036` | PEQ | 0x9 | 27 |
| compressor | `0x002e` | COMP | 0x7 | 28 |
| **ingate** | `0x0025` | INPUT | 0x29 | 8 (Input Noise Gate, not slot-placeable) |

## Global Block Architecture

- **4 effect slots per preset** (1 Amp+Cab integrated, 3 free effect slots).
- **4 channels per block** (A / B / C / D): each channel independently
  selects its own TYPE and parameter values within the block.
- **4 scenes per preset**: each scene captures which channel is active
  per block plus per-block bypass state.

---

## Amp Block

- **Role:** amp modeler; always present as the core of a preset.
- **Cab integration:** Cabinet simulation is integrated with the Amp block
  on AM4 (DynaCab linking enabled by default; can be disabled).
- **Models:** ~437 amp models catalogued in `docs/wiki/Amp_models_list.md`,
  organized by era and family (vintage tweed, blackface/silverface,
  British plexi/plexi-derived, modern high-gain, boutique, bass).
- **Status:** Full model-name list not yet extracted into this document;
  the raw file is 289 KB and contains tables the wiki→markdown converter
  could not translate. **Treat Amp_models_list.md as the authoritative
  source until a structured extraction is produced.** [FLAG: VERIFY]
- **Wire-protocol layout (Expert page):** the AM4-Edit Expert
  page for the amp surfaces 4 UI tabs (Preamp / Power Amp / Cabinet /
  Speaker). Three of those (Preamp, Power Amp, Speaker) write to the
  amp `pidLow=0x003a`. The Cabinet tab writes to a **separate**
  `pidLow=0x003e`. See `SYSEX-MAP.md §6k` for the protocol details
  and `params.ts` Expert-page block for the 61 registered knobs
  (Preamp 12 + Power Amp 21 + Cabinet 16 + Speaker 12).

## Cab Block (integrated with Amp on AM4)

- **Technology:** DynaCabs (dynamic mic-positioned cabinet modeling).
- **IR count:** 2 IRs per channel.
- **Mic options (DynaCab):** Dynamic 1 (SM57), Dynamic 2 (SM7B),
  Ribbon (Royer 121), Condenser (Soyuz 023).
- **Legacy support:** 189 legacy cabs from Axe-Fx II XL+/AX8.
- **User IR slots:** 256, UltraRes supported.
- **Factory DynaCabs:** must be installed separately per Fractal instructions.
- **Protocol address:** `pidLow=0x003e` (separate from the amp block's
  `0x003a`). User-facing namespace stays under `amp.*` for the four
  Expert tabs; cabinet entries in `params.ts` hold `pidLow=0x003e`
  directly. See `SYSEX-MAP.md §6k`.

## Drive Block

- **Role:** overdrive, distortion, boost, fuzz.
- **Type count:** 100+ models (file is 289 KB; full list not extracted here).
- **Categorization (from wiki):**
  - Clean Boost
  - Bass drive
  - Fuzz
  - Amp-in-a-box / Overdrive / Distortion
  - Metal / high-gain
  - Other
- **Reference pedals include:** TS808/TS9/TS9DX family, DS-1, RAT, Klon-style,
  Muff-style, various boutique clones. **Full verbatim list pending
  structured extraction from `docs/wiki/Drive_block.md`.** [FLAG: VERIFY]

## Parametric EQ Block

- [FLAG: VERIFY] The scraped `Parametric_EQ_block.md` is a redirect stub:

## Cross-Cutting Notes

- **Per-channel type selection:** every effect block listed above exposes all
  its TYPES independently per channel A/B/C/D, except the Amp block (where
  the channel usually represents an amp-model variant or boost stage).
- **CPU budget:** drive and compressor types vary substantially in CPU cost;
  preset validation will need a cost table (not yet captured). See
  `docs/wiki/` once CPU_usage is added to the P0 scrape set.
- **Firmware drift:** type lists change between firmwares. Wiki scrape is a
  snapshot: when AM4 firmware updates arrive, re-run the scraper and diff
  `docs/wiki/` before trusting new type names.

## Extraction Gaps To Close

1. **Amp models**: structured extraction from `Amp_models_list.md` (289 KB).
2. **Drive types**: structured extraction from `Drive_block.md` (289 KB).
3. **Parametric EQ**: pull from the AM4 owner's manual; wiki page is a stub.
4. **Rotary**: confirm there is no TYPE selector; document the speed /
   spacing parameter ranges instead.
5. **Per-type parameter tables**: every TYPE here has its own parameter set
   (e.g. a Tape delay has Age/Bias/Hiss; a Digital delay does not). These
   will be captured incrementally as presets are built.
