# Reverse-engineering workflow

This is the long-form RE workflow for `mcp-midi-control`. The project's
`CLAUDE.md` holds a one-paragraph pointer at this file. Read this
end-to-end before any decode session, capture analysis, or new probe
script. Skipping it has cost multi-session dead-ends (a 21-capture,
70-minute plan in one case; a WinDbg trap-after-launch that cannot
fire by construction in another).

The discipline below is the accumulated lesson set from real decode
sessions. None of it is theoretical; every rule names the bug class
that produced it.

---

## Session-start reading order

Read these in order before doing decode work. Each one rules out a
class of wasted effort the others do not.

1. **The maintainer's private state notes (gitignored)** plus the
   per-device shard for the device you are working on (the maintainer
   keeps a main cross-device state file and one shard per device:
   AM4, Axe-Fx II, Axe-Fx III, Hydrasynth). Cross-device sessions stay
   in the main state file; device-specific sessions live in the shards.
   Always first.
2. **The maintainer's private captured-artifacts manifest (gitignored,
   if present).** Lists decompile dumps, USB captures, and factory
   dumps that do not ship publicly. Always grep `samples/captured/decoded/`
   before proposing a new Ghidra run; there is significant material
   already mined.
3. **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/INDEX.md`**, the encoding
   primitive Rosetta stone. Before researching any new wire shape,
   scan the cookbook. The shape may already be a known primitive
   (septet, XOR-fold, descriptor-table, etc.). Cookbook entries are
   the canonical source for "how Fractal encodes X."
4. **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/_negative/`** for methods
   ruled out. Always grep before re-attempting a technique that
   "feels useful." Expect the entry count to grow over time.
5. **`packages/fractal-midi/docs/research/fractal-protocol-decode-status.md`**,
   the per-device decode status table. Read before opening any new
   investigation so you know what is already named vs. open.
6. **`docs/devices/captures-inventory.md`** lists what `.pcapng` /
   `.syx` captures and Ghidra dumps already exist. Always check this
   BEFORE asking the maintainer for more captures. A past attempt
   proposed a 21-capture plan without checking the inventory; multiple
   relevant captures already existed.
7. **Your local hardware-task notes (the maintainer keeps these per
   device, gitignored)** list open captures the maintainer owes. If a
   pending task gates the work you are about to do, surface it instead
   of speculating around the missing data.
8. **Per-device wire map** at `packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/<device>/SYSEX-MAP.md`.
   For Axe-Fx II also read `axeedit-opcode-table.md` (94 wire opcodes).
   For AM4 also read `param-rename-audit.md`.
9. **`docs/REFERENCES.md`**, only the section for your device. Do
   not WebFetch for a manual already extracted to `.txt` locally.

`npm run coverage-audit` is optional at session start (coverage sits at
AM4 100%, II ~97.4%). Run it when touching the codec or `params.ts`,
after pulling `fractal-midi` changes, or when the maintainer's open
follow-ups feel out of sync with reality.

## Capture methods, in order of preference

### Hardware-free lanes (exhaust these BEFORE queuing maintainer time)

- **Existing captures.** `samples/captured/` holds ~170 files
  (gitignored, local-only). Many decode targets are already covered.
  See `docs/devices/captures-inventory.md` for the full index by device
  and decode purpose.
- **Ghidra mining.** Canonical for paramId to name catalog discovery
  (99% wire-accuracy verified). Also for SysEx opcode-table decode:
  the full AxeEdit II wire vocabulary (94 opcodes) was mined via 6
  GhidraScripts in ~30 minutes wall time. Ghidra works for the 32-bit
  AxeEdit II binary too: `SeekParamTablesII.java` direct-pattern-scan
  recovers 1,113 paramId/symbol entries at 99% indexed-symbol coverage.
  See
  [`fractal-midi/docs/research/ghidra-mining-workflow.md`](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/fractal-midi/blob/main/docs/research/ghidra-mining-workflow.md).
  - **Enum VALUE tables (wire-index to option label): harder than it looks;
    the dropdown order is a TRAP and a raw Ghidra scan does not work either.**
    Do NOT transcribe enum option order from an AM4-Edit / AxeEdit dropdown:
    the editor sorts dropdowns for DISPLAY (alphabetical / by band-count /
    grouped), NOT wire-index order. Proven 2026-05-31: `amp.geq_type` reads
    wire=0 for "8 Band Var Q", but AM4-Edit lists it LAST (display pos 10/11).
    A screenshot gives the right label SET, a WRONG index map. The AM4 also
    echoes no ASCII label over MIDI (enum `get_param` returns the raw index).
    And a raw Ghidra `.rdata` scan ALSO fails: the option labels live in
    COMPRESSED JUCE BinaryData (ZIP/gzip in `.rsrc`) which Ghidra never
    inflates, so the discriminating labels are absent from a static memory
    walk (`SeekParamTables*` extracts (paramId, symbol) only; the 16-byte
    ParamDescriptor has no options pointer). Working lanes, in order: (1) the
    HARDWARE WIRE-SWEEP, which actually resolved the AM4 set 2026-05-31: set
    each wire index and read the DEVICE FRONT-PANEL value per step (NOT
    AM4-Edit, which owns the port and re-sorts its list).
    `scripts/_research/probe-am4-enum-sweep.ts` automates it and uses the
    readback clamp to auto-detect table size. CONFIRMED RULE: the device
    front-panel knob order (clockwise from start = index 0) IS the wire order;
    only the editor dropdown re-sorts. (2) JUCE BinaryData DECOMPRESSED
    (recovered 1,299 AM4-Edit labels, but NOT the dropdown option lists, which
    proved absent); (3) re-parse the editor cache `effectDefinitions_*.cache`
    for a per-param option-INDEX map (its model-dictionary array order is also
    NOT wire order). ALWAYS verify index 0 against hardware ground truth. Full
    writeup: cookbook `_negative/am4-edit-dropdown-order-not-wire-order`.
- **JUCE BinaryData extraction.** 5-minute label discovery from
  editor binaries via the embedded ZIP. 1,299 AM4-Edit labels and
  10,250 AxeEdit III labels recovered this way. See
  [`fractal-midi/docs/capture-guides/juce-binarydata-extraction.md`](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/fractal-midi/blob/main/docs/capture-guides/juce-binarydata-extraction.md).

### Hardware lanes (only after the above is exhausted)

- **Directed probe scripts** (`scripts/probe*.ts`). Cheap, scriptable,
  default for unknown wire envelopes. One hypothesis per probe; keep
  the probe read-only unless explicitly designed to write.
- **Passive capture.** Open the device MIDI input with no editor.
  Axe-Fx II broadcasts state continuously; AM4 is silent and needs
  an active query loop. See
  [`fractal-midi/docs/research/fractal-broadcast-vs-poll-research.md`](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/fractal-midi/blob/main/docs/research/fractal-broadcast-vs-poll-research.md).
- **USBPcap + Wireshark.** Captures both directions at the USB-class
  layer when the editor → device direction is needed. The
  maintainer's default for editor-write decode. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  for the step-by-step.

---

## Scientific discipline

Rules forged by real bugs. Each one is the consequence of a specific
class of mistake; the rule names the class.

- **Every new `pidHigh` in `params.ts` requires a `verify-msg.ts`
  golden built from captured bytes.** Septet-encoded 14-bit fields
  are easy to misread as little-endian. An early session cost a day
  on this class; the golden is the only mechanical guard against it.
- **Front panel + `get_param` echo are ground truth.** AxeEdit and
  AM4-Edit cache stale UI state (a freshly-placed Volume block once
  showed 10.00 in the editor while the device held 0.00). On
  disagreement, the editor is wrong.
- **Read before write.** Every device tool gates writes behind a
  fingerprint read. Do not bypass this in new probe scripts unless
  they are explicitly read-only (`scripts/probe.ts` is read-only
  forever, by policy).
- **One capture per hypothesis.** When isolating an unknown field,
  change exactly one input on the editor or device. Two simultaneous
  edits produce ambiguous diff bytes and cost days.
- **Variant-dependent binding.** The same `parameterName` maps to
  different wire IDs across effect variants (e.g. `DISTORT_TONE` is
  `drive.id=12` in some variants, `drive.id=23` in others). XML alone
  is never sufficient. Combine with a capture or the Ghidra paramId
  table. See cookbook `_negative/positional-xml-cache-binding.md`.
- **Septet-encode every 14-bit field, not just `pidLow`.** `action`,
  effect IDs, preset numbers, tempo BPM, location bytes are all
  7-bit-pair encoded. Forgetting once produces a wire mismatch and
  a confused device.
- **Cite captures with file path + byte offset** in every SYSEX-MAP
  entry so future agents can re-verify. "Confirmed via capture"
  without a reference is hearsay.

## Capability-application pre-flight (5 checks)

Before wiring a decoded primitive into a shipping tool path, run a
5-check pre-flight and cite the evidence in the commit body. Designed
to catch the misapplication failure class (e.g. a `get_preset`
regression with +1.5-2s latency, stale source-of-truth, wrong bug-fix
mapping, and scaffolding placeholders) and the N=1 generalization-claim
trap (e.g. a paramBase shipped as generalized when it only worked for
one amp model).

1. **Latency check.** Estimate or measure round-trip cost; compare
   to the < 1 s tool-call budget. State the number in the commit
   body.
2. **Source-of-truth check.** Name which source the primitive reads
   (working buffer / stored binary at active location / stored
   binary at non-active location / cached snapshot / front-panel
   echo). If the existing code path read source S1 and your change
   demotes it to S2, that is a correctness regression. Flip it back
   before shipping.
3. **Bug-fix mapping.** If claiming "this fixes bug X," name the
   code path X lives in (`file:line`). Name the code path being
   changed (`file:line`). If the two are different, the framing is
   wrong. STOP. Cookbook entries' `Misapplication failure modes`
   sections name common bug-X-doesn't-live-here cases (e.g.
   `atomic-preset-dump` does NOT fix the channel-Y write loss bug;
   channel-Y is a write-path bug).
4. **Scaffolding check.** Grep the diff for `0 ? undefined : undefined`,
   `// TODO`, `// scaffolding`, hardcoded `0` returned for "real
   later," typed-but-never-set fields. If any are present, the
   change is WIP, not shippable.
5. **Generalization-claim check (N=1 trap).** When claiming a
   primitive "generalizes" (across blocks / across presets / across
   firmwares / across devices), cite ≥ 2 distinct test cases varying
   along the generalization axis. N=1 is not generalization. If only
   N=1 is verified, ship as `cookbook/_partial/` with `status: partial-N1`;
   do NOT ship as `matched`. If a co-resident or cross-variant probe
   is cheap (< 5 min wire time), run it BEFORE shipping.

### What the build gate enforces

`scripts/cookbook-verify.ts` mechanically enforces **check 5 only**:
`status='matched'` requires `verified_on` to list ≥ 2 axis points
(see `cookbook-verify.ts:332`). Checks 1, 2, 3, 4 are reviewer and
agent discipline, not mechanical gates. A `_scratch/` entry whose
golden unexpectedly passes is a policy violation per `INDEX.md`, not
a build-gated failure.

## Cross-device transfer reflex (at session close)

When you discover or refine a primitive on one device, scan the
other three device wire-maps + `fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/`
for analogous decode gaps. File same-session `[transfer-candidate]`
follow-ups in each affected device's private per-device state notes
(or hardware-task notes), naming the transfer hypothesis plus the
cheapest test to confirm.

Real evidence: the Axe-Fx III preset binary envelope is byte-
identical in shape to the II envelope (same
`(tag, mid, byte_count)` descriptor table layout). Multiple sessions
of II hardware-probe work could have been recognized as a III-
decodable target months ago if the transfer reflex had been a
session-close ritual. Do not repeat that miss. Cross-device
transfer findings are the highest-yield decode moves in the
codebase.

---

## Negative findings are first-class artifacts

When a probe rules a hypothesis OUT (e.g. confirming that the
AM4-shaped `0x77` envelope is inert as a save attempt on
Axe-Fx II), commit the result to:

- The relevant `SYSEX-MAP-*.md` entry, or the maintainer's private
  session log (gitignored), with the search terms a future agent would
  use ("AM4 0x77 as save on II, no").
- **`fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/_negative/<name>.md`** when
  it is a primitive-level claim ("this encoding scheme doesn't apply
  to device X" / "this technique was ruled out"). The cookbook's
  `_negative/` directory is the canonical "methods that don't work"
  home that the next agent greps before re-attempting.

A negative finding that is not registered will be re-attempted. The
project has paid that cost more than once.

## Same-session artifact registration

Every new Ghidra script, decompile dump, capture-of-interest, OR
encoding primitive must be registered in the appropriate index the
SAME SESSION it is produced. Not "I'll add it later."

- New Ghidra script → `fractal-midi/scripts/ghidra/README.md` registry
- New decompile dump or capture-of-interest →
  `fractal-midi/docs/research/captured-artifacts.md` (public) or
  the maintainer's private captured-artifacts manifest (gitignored;
  maintainer hardware plus factory dumps)
- New encoding primitive →
  `fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/<name>.md` with a matching
  golden case in `scripts/cookbook-verify.ts`
- New negative finding →
  `fractal-midi/docs/research/cookbook/_negative/<name>.md`
- New synthesis-review output →
  `fractal-midi/docs/research/synthesis-log/<slug>.md` committed the
  same session it is produced. The log is the only evidence the
  synthesis cadence is alive; without committed artifacts the
  cadence-rot fail-mode the discipline warns about is invisible.

Same-session registration is the same discipline as the existing
"verify-msg golden per new pidHigh" rule, promoted one level up.

---

## Param-coverage audit reflex

When grepping `fractal-midi/src/<device>/params.ts` to confirm
whether a param is registered, the registered name often differs
from the Blocks Guide / Owner's Manual spelling because params are
renamed for AM4-Edit / front-panel UI-label match. Naive search for
the manual's wording produces false negatives.

Before opening a "missing param" investigation, re-grep using the
device's short canonical spellings (`_sw`, `_fb`, `preamp_*`,
`nfb_*`, `in_*` prefix variants). For the full known-divergence
table on AM4, see
[`fractal-midi/docs/devices/am4/param-rename-audit.md`](../packages/fractal-midi/docs/devices/am4/param-rename-audit.md).
