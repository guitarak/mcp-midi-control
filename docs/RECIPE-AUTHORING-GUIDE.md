# Recipe Authoring Guide

How to add a tone-building recipe (a hand-curated starting point the
agent can apply via `apply_preset({recipe_id})` for guitar devices or
`apply_patch({recipe_id})` for synths) so the agent stops guessing knob
values and pastes from a documented player rig or a known synth voice.

This guide is for community contributors. It pairs with
[`docs/TOOL-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md`](TOOL-AUTHORING-GUIDE.md): that one
covers the MCP tool surface itself; this one covers the curated data
layered on top.

`recipe_id` works on BOTH apply tools. On linear guitar devices (AM4,
Axe-Fx II, Axe-Fx III) it rides `apply_preset`. On the Hydrasynth it
rides `apply_patch`. Both expand the recipe into ordinary tool calls,
so every safe-edit gate still fires.

## What a recipe is

A recipe encodes ONE iconic tone, with:

- Per-device slot list (block placement + knob values + enum picks).
- A short prose description that names the player / era / song so
  the agent knows when to suggest it.
- A `signature_params` dict naming the 2-4 most distinctive picks
  (e.g. `amp.type='Brit Silver'`, `delay.feedback=25`). The agent
  uses these to disambiguate between sibling recipes from the slim
  `describe_device.recipes[]` surface.
- A `source_notes` line citing where the values came from (Premier
  Guitar rig rundown, Sound on Sound feature, forum thread with
  player confirmation).

The agent discovers recipes via `describe_device(port).recipes[]` and
applies them via `apply_preset({port, recipe_id, overrides?})` (guitar)
or `apply_patch({port, recipe_id, overrides?})` (Hydrasynth). The
dispatcher materializes recipe + overrides into a normal spec before
preflight, so every existing safety gate (type-knob applicability,
phantom-param, channel-Y inactive on guitar; range and routing checks
on synth) still fires.

---

## Families

There are two groups, split by device family because the expansion
differs.

### Guitar families (linear devices: AM4, Axe-Fx II, Axe-Fx III)

| Family | Shape | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| `block_stack` | Multi-slot signal chain | Slim summary; apply via `recipe_id` |
| `auto_wah` / `pitch` / `wah` / `filter` / `scene_leveling` | Single-block | Full params inline in `describe_device.recipes[]` |

Single-block recipes apply via `set_block` / `set_params` / direct
`apply_preset` slot. They ship inline because the params dict is
small and the agent uses it directly. The guitar side ships utility
recipes for the common "make me a X" requests where parameter
relationships matter: pitch, wah, filter, auto-wah, diatonic pitch.

Block-stack recipes ship slim (id, description, slot_count,
target_blocks, signature_params) because their full slot trees are
6 to 9 KB per device. The agent picks by id; the dispatcher
materializes.

### Synth family (Hydrasynth): patch archetypes

This family is **shipped and live** through `apply_patch`. A
`patch_archetype` is a named, display-first starting point for a synth
voice: oscillator setup, filter, envelopes, and optional mod-matrix
and macro routing. Block-stack semantics don't translate to synth
patches, so an archetype carries a base param list in display units
plus optional routing-by-name instead of a slot tree.

Around 33 archetypes have been auditioned on the Hydrasynth Explorer
hardware. The ones that reproduce reliably are curated into the
shipped set. Examples: a Prophet-5 warm analog pad, a Juno-106 chorus
pad, an OB-Xa brass/jump lead.

---

## Curation criteria

Every recipe must satisfy:

1. **Recognizable.** A working guitarist should recognize the tone
   from the name without explanation. "Edge dotted-eighth lead", "80s
   metal brown sound", "Texas blues crunch", not "warm clean tone."
   For synth archetypes the same rule applies by classic-synth name:
   "Prophet-5 pad", "Juno-106 pad", "OB-Xa Jump".

2. **Sourced.** The knob values come from a public, documented source
   you can cite. Cite it in `source_notes`. No "I dialed this in by
   ear and it sounded right" recipes; those go in the user's
   personal preset library, not the shared corpus. Synth archetypes
   additionally must round-trip on hardware before they are curated
   (see the patch-archetype authoring section).

3. **Enum-verified.** Every `amp.type` / `drive.type` / `reverb.type`
   string in the recipe MUST exist in the target device's catalog
   verbatim. Verify at authoring time:
   ```
   grep -r "'BRIT SILVER'" packages/axe-fx-ii/  # for II
   grep -r "Brit Silver" packages/am4/          # for AM4
   ```
   If the enum doesn't exist, the recipe ships broken; the recipe-
   table preflight (`scripts/verify-recipe-tables.ts`) will catch it
   at CI time.

4. **Slot-fits the device.** Block-stack recipes that need 5+ slots
   are II-only (AM4 has a 4-slot linear chain). Document the AM4
   absence in the recipe's header comment.

5. **No improvised middle-ground.** If the tone is fundamentally a
   different rig on a different device (e.g. djent on AM4 needs a
   noise gate + sub-cut that won't fit four slots), omit that device
   from `applicable_devices`. Don't ship a "best approximation" that
   no one will recognize.

## Authoring a new block_stack recipe

Walk through what changes where.

### 1. Add the recipe entry

Edit `packages/core/src/protocol-generic/recipes/blockStack.ts`. Add
a new entry to `BLOCK_STACK_RECIPES`:

```ts
my_recipe_id: {
  name: 'my_recipe_id',
  description:
    'Player / era / song reference: chain shape + headline knobs.',
  applicable_devices: ['am4', 'axe-fx-ii'] as const,
  signature_params_per_device: {
    am4: { 'amp.type': '<verified enum>', 'drive.type': '<verified enum>' },
    'axe-fx-ii': { 'amp.effect_type': '<VERIFIED ENUM>', 'drive.effect_type': '<VERIFIED ENUM>' },
  },
  source_notes:
    'Cite the public source (Premier Guitar, Sound on Sound, etc).',
  slots_per_device: {
    am4: [
      { slot: 1, block_type: 'drive', params: p({ type: '<enum>', ... }) },
      { slot: 2, block_type: 'amp',   params: p({ type: '<enum>', ... }) },
      // ...
    ],
    'axe-fx-ii': [
      { slot: { row: 2, col: 1 }, block_type: 'drive', params: p({ effect_type: '<ENUM>', ... }) },
      { slot: { row: 2, col: 2 }, block_type: 'amp',   params: p({ effect_type: '<ENUM>', ... }) },
      // ...
    ],
  },
},
```

`signature_params_per_device` is REQUIRED and CI-validated:
- Every key must be a `<block_type>.<param_name>` dot-path.
- The value must match the corresponding param in `slots_per_device`
  for the same port (drift fails the build).
- Pick 2-4 keys per device, the ones that DISTINGUISH this recipe
  from siblings. The amp type is almost always one. A
  characteristic effect (delay type, drive type, modulation rate) is
  another.

### 2. CI gates

`scripts/verify-recipe-tables.ts` runs in `npm test`. It verifies for
every recipe:

- `applicable_devices` non-empty.
- For each applicable port: `slots_per_device[port]` is non-empty
  AND `signature_params_per_device[port]` is non-empty.
- Every `signature_params` key resolves to a real slot+param.
- Every `signature_params` value matches the slot's authored value.
- Materializer round-trip: `materializeBlockStackRecipe(name, port,
  undefined)` returns the expected slots.
- Materializer overrides merge: applying an override produces a spec
  with the override applied AND the recipe's other knobs preserved.
- Verbatim equivalence: materialize(name, port, undefined).slots
  deep-equals `slots_per_device[port]`.
- Non-applicable port throws `RecipeMaterializeError`.

If any gate fires, fix the recipe rather than adjusting the gate.

### 3. Agent-regression case (optional, future)

When a recipe is iconic enough that we want to PROVE the agent picks
it up from a natural prompt, add an agent-regression case under
`scripts/agent-regression/cases-<device>.ts`. Existing examples:
`axefx2-recipe-block-stack-pickup`, `am4-recipe-block-stack-pickup`
(disabled by default until validated).

Pattern:
```ts
{
  id: '<device>-recipe-<recipe_id>-pickup',
  device: '<device>',
  tier: 'hardware',
  description: 'Agent picks the <recipe_id> recipe by id...',
  prompt: 'A natural-language prompt the agent should map to the recipe',
  expectations: {
    must_call: ['describe_device', 'apply_preset'],
    tool_call_validators: [{
      tool: 'apply_preset',
      call_index: 0,
      check: (args) => {
        if (args.recipe_id !== '<recipe_id>') {
          return `Expected recipe_id='<recipe_id>'; got ${JSON.stringify(args.recipe_id)}.`;
        }
        return true;
      },
    }],
  },
}
```

---

## Authoring a single-block recipe

Single-block families ship full params inline. Each family has its
own file (`autoWah.ts`, `pitch.ts`, `filter.ts`, `wah.ts`,
`sceneLeveling.ts`). Follow the existing entries' shape:

```ts
my_single_block_recipe: {
  name: 'my_single_block_recipe',
  description: 'What this tone evokes',
  applicable_devices: ['am4', 'axe-fx-ii'],
  params_per_device: {
    am4: { rate: 0.8, depth: 60, /* ... */ },
    'axe-fx-ii': { rate: 0.8, depth: 60, /* ... */ },
  },
  target_block_per_device: {
    am4: 'filter',
    'axe-fx-ii': 'wah',  // II uses WAH block for auto-wah
  },
  // optional:
  modifier_needed_on: { am4: true, 'axe-fx-ii': true },
},
```

The cross-device divergence is built into the schema (auto-wah lives
on FILTER on AM4 but WAH on II). Use `target_block_per_device` to
expose the per-device routing.

## Authoring a Hydrasynth patch archetype

Synth archetypes are display-first param lists plus optional routing
by name. They live in
`packages/core/src/protocol-generic/recipes/patchArchetype.curated.ts`
(the curated, hardware-auditioned set) with the shape and support
types in `patchArchetype.ts` and `patchRecipeTypes.ts`.

1. **Pick a `recipe_id`.** Lowercase snake_case, unique. Example:
   `juno106_pad`.
2. **Declare base params** in display units. Use musician-facing
   names (`filter_cutoff`, `amp_env_attack`) and display values
   (wave names like `'saw'`, ms, cutoff readings). Never expose a
   wire index or an internal bucket number; the codec owns the
   inverse for non-linear params (env / LFO time tables).
3. **Add routing by name** if the voice needs it. A `mod_routes`
   entry names `source` / `dest` / `depth`; a `macro_routes` entry
   names `macro` / `dest` / `depth`. The codec resolves a name like
   `lfo1` or `filter_cutoff` to the right mod-matrix or macro slot,
   so you never touch a routing index. This is the same name-based
   routing the `set_mod_route` and `set_macro_route` tools use.

   The shape, in display terms (read an existing curated entry for the
   exact field names and types before adding one):

   ```
   recipe_id:    'prophet5_pad'
   description:  'Prophet-5 style warm analog pad'
   base params:  osc1 wave = saw, filter cutoff = 62,
                 amp env release = 1800 ms
   mod routes:   lfo1 -> filter cutoff, depth 22
   macro routes: macro 1 -> filter cutoff, depth 40
   ```

4. **Audition on hardware.** Add an archetype to
   `patchArchetype.curated.ts` only after it round-trips on the
   Hydrasynth Explorer. The curated file is the hardware-verified
   set, not a wish list. An archetype that has not been heard on
   real hardware does not belong in the curated set.
5. **Register it** so the dispatcher and `apply_patch` pick it up,
   and so `describe_device(port).recipes[]` lists it.
6. **Test it.** The curated archetypes carry a test
   (`patchArchetype.curated.test.ts`) that validates their shape.
   Extend it for the new entry.

A patch archetype applies via `apply_patch({port, recipe_id})`. It
edits the active patch and never persists; the user still has to ask
to save, exactly like a manual edit.

---

## Authoring a brand-new family

If a new shape doesn't fit `block_stack`, any existing single-block
family, or the patch-archetype family (for example an FX-loop recipe
or a drum-pad kit), add a new family:

1. Define the recipe spec interface in a new file under `recipes/`.
   Mirror the existing single-block-family interfaces
   (`AutoWahRecipeSpec`, `PitchRecipeSpec`, etc) or the
   patch-archetype types.
2. Add the family table + resolver function (`MY_FAMILY_RECIPES`,
   `resolveMyFamilyRecipe`).
3. Add the family to `RecipeSummaryEntry.family` union in
   `summary.ts`.
4. Extend `summarizeRecipesForPort` to emit the family's entries.
5. Decide: inline params (small) or slim summary (large)? Inline is
   fine if the params dict is < 200 bytes; switch to slim with a
   materializer (like block_stack's `materializeBlockStackRecipe`)
   above that.
6. Extend `scripts/verify-recipe-tables.ts` with the family's
   integrity checks (the existing block_stack section is a template).

Discuss the design before doing the work: a new family changes the
contract surface, and pinging the maintainer first saves rewrites.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't ship a recipe you can't cite.** "I made this up and it
  sounds great" is fine for personal presets, not for the shared
  corpus.
- **Don't approximate cross-device.** If the tone doesn't translate
  (djent on AM4), omit the device. A bad approximation is worse than
  no entry.
- **Don't skip `signature_params`.** CI enforces it, but more
  importantly the agent uses it to pick between siblings. Without it
  the slim summary becomes ambiguous.
- **Don't extend `signature_params` to non-distinctive knobs.** It's
  a disambiguator, not a full enumeration. 2-4 picks per device. If
  every knob is "signature" then none of them are.
- **Don't bake firmware-version-specific values.** Enums shift
  between firmware versions; if a value is only stable on Q8.02,
  pick a different recipe or omit that device until the enum
  stabilizes.

---

## Examples worth reading

In `packages/core/src/protocol-generic/recipes/blockStack.ts`:

- `edge_dotted_eighth_lead`: the canonical block_stack example.
  Multi-block chain, dual-device, dense documentation header, cited
  sources, distinctive signature_params (Brit Silver + Digital
  Stereo delay + 25% feedback).
- `djent_gated_5150`: single-device (II-only) because the chain
  needs 5 slots. Header documents WHY AM4 is absent rather than
  shipping a bad approximation.
- `texas_blues_crunch`: minimal 3-block chain. Shows that recipes
  don't need to be long; iconic is what matters.

In `packages/core/src/protocol-generic/recipes/autoWah.ts`:

- `auto_wah_funk`: cross-device divergence handled cleanly via
  `target_block_per_device`. AM4 uses FILTER, II uses WAH; both
  carry envelope-follower types.

In `packages/core/src/protocol-generic/recipes/patchArchetype.curated.ts`:

- The curated Hydrasynth archetypes: each names base params in
  display units and routes mod/macro destinations by name. Read one
  before authoring a new synth voice; the Prophet-5 and Juno-106 pads
  show the param + routing shape.
