//
// Cross-device RESPONSE-SHAPE parity gate (P1a-response-shape-parity).
//
// Goal: catch the AM4-vs-Axe-Fx-II `get_preset` / `get_params` divergence
// class. Concretely, the bug this gate forecloses is a device whose
// reader silently STOPS declaring a field its sibling device declares
// (e.g. AM4 omitting `active_scene`, per-slot `bypassed`, `_meta`, or
// `ReadResult.raw_response` that the Axe-Fx II response includes), so an
// agent that learned the shape from one device breaks when pointed at the
// other.
//
// Approach (runtime, mock-driven, the reliable offline path):
//   1. Set MCP_MOCK_TRANSPORT=1 so the device connectXXX wrappers return
//      an in-memory mock MidiConnection (same pattern verify-dispatcher.ts
//      and the agent-regression harness use; see
//      packages/core/src/midi/transport.ts:mockConnect + each device's
//      midi.ts mock responder).
//   2. Build a real DispatchCtx { conn, descriptor } per device.
//   3. Drive the device's OWN reader (descriptor.reader.getPreset /
//      getParam) end-to-end against the mock. The returned object is the
//      actual response envelope the MCP tool layer would serialize.
//   4. Assert the envelope conforms to a CONTRACT: a set of fields the
//      response MUST declare, plus an EXPLICIT per-device allowlist of
//      intentional omissions (documented inline with the reason).
//
// AM4, Axe-Fx II, and the gen-3 Axe-Fx III all get RUNTIME shape
// assertions (their mock responders synthesize enough wire shapes to run
// getPreset and getParam against the mock). The gen-3 mock synthesizes the
// device's 0x74/0x75/0x76 state-broadcast burst in answer to the reader's
// fn=0x1F bulk-read poll (see packages/fractal-gen3/src/parityMock.ts).
// Hydrasynth does not implement the slot/scene getPreset contract and is
// reported as not-applicable, not silently skipped.
//
// Run:  npx tsx scripts/verify-response-shape-parity.ts
//
// Status: offline, no hardware required.
