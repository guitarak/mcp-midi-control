/**
 * Verify `isWriteEcho` matches real captured device echoes and rejects
 * non-echo traffic. The byte sequences below come from
 * samples/captured/session-18-read-response-gain-a01.pcapng — the A01
 * capture where amp.gain was set to 6.0 via the hardware encoder.
 *
 * Why this matters: the server uses `isWriteEcho` to decide whether a
 * write to a placed block succeeded vs. was silently absorbed by the
 * device. A regression here would turn "write confirmed" into "write
 * lost" or vice versa — unit-testing it against real bytes is the only
 * way to catch that without hardware in the loop.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx scripts/verify-echo.ts
