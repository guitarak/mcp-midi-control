/**
 * HW-071 — find the live bypass-read register (HW-066 follow-up).
 *
 * HW-066 confirmed `pidHigh=0x0003` is NOT the live bypass register on
 * AM4: reads at that address return a static value per block that does
 * not track bypass writes (audio + LCD + script all confirm the WRITE
 * lands; only the read is wrong). The bypass-state mapping in
 * `src/server/index.ts:1481` was deduced from HW-047 active-state-only
 * captures and never empirically validated against the bypassed state.
 *
 * This script sweeps pidHigh values at one block's pidLow looking for
 * a register whose read DOES track bypass-on / bypass-off writes.
 *
 * Method (one block — reverb, pidLow=0x0042):
 *   1. Write bypass(true) at (0x0042, 0x0003). Sleep.
 *   2. Read u32 at (0x0042, pidHigh) for every pidHigh in the sweep.
 *   3. Write bypass(false) at (0x0042, 0x0003). Sleep.
 *   4. Read u32 at (0x0042, pidHigh) for every pidHigh again.
 *   5. Diff: any pidHigh whose two reads differ is a candidate live
 *      bypass register. Reads that time out are recorded as NO_READ
 *      and flagged separately.
 *
 * Why reverb: definitely placed in Z04 (HW-064 setup), audibly bright
 * so audio truth is unambiguous, and one of the four blocks HW-064
 * specifically called out as misreporting.
 *
 * If the sweep finds a hit on reverb at pidHigh=X, sanity-check on amp
 * by setting `BLOCK_PID_LOW = 0x003a` and re-running — same pidHigh
 * should track for both blocks. If reverb returns nothing, widen the
 * pidHigh range or move to slot-position-keyed addressing
 * (pidLow=0x00CE family) as a follow-up.
 *
 * Setup:
 *   - AM4 plugged in.
 *   - Close AM4-Edit (it polls and would noise the reads).
 *   - Z04 loaded with reverb placed in the chain.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx tsx scripts/find-bypass-register.ts
