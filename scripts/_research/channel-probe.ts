/**
 * HW-048 — Per-block channel-state register encoding probe.
 *
 * HW-047 established that reading at (0x003A, 0x07D2) — the address
 * the channel WRITE side uses — returned u32 = 11244 when amp was on
 * channel B (= index 1), not the clean integer or Q15 we'd expected.
 * The wire address is correct for writes (Session 09 confirmed across
 * A/B/C/D), so the read must be returning derived/cached firmware
 * state, not the channel index directly.
 *
 * Three angles in one capture:
 *   (1) Re-read (0x003A, 0x07D2) at the start — confirms HW-047's
 *       u32 = 11244 is reproducible (or evolving).
 *   (2) Read adjacent pidHighs 0x07D1 and 0x07D3 — the actual channel-
 *       state register may live one step away from the write
 *       address.
 *   (3) Write→Read echo test: write channel B, immediately read
 *       (0x003A, 0x07D2). If the read returns the just-written
 *       float32(1.0) bit-pattern (low bytes after Q15 shift), the
 *       register IS the channel store. If it returns 11244 again or
 *       something else, the register is genuinely a separate piece
 *       of firmware state.
 *   (4) Sweep all four channels with a read after each switch. If
 *       the four u32 values cluster (e.g., ~11244 / ~22488 / ~33732
 *       / ~44976 — multiples of ~11244), then the channel index IS
 *       encoded but with a peculiar scale. If all four values are
 *       identical, the register is a per-block constant unrelated
 *       to channel.
 *
 * SAFETY: this script issues channel-switch WRITES (4 of them, one
 * per channel). It does NOT change params. The user's amp-block
 * channel will end up on D after the script (last channel walked).
 * Switch back manually afterwards if you want to preserve the
 * starting channel.
 *
 * Capture procedure (founder-side):
 *   1. Connect AM4 via USB. Close AM4-Edit. Note the starting amp
 *      channel.
 *   2. Start USBPcap on the AM4's USB endpoint, save to
 *      `samples/captured/session-NN-channel-probe.pcapng`.
 *   3. Run `npm run channel-probe` (or `npx tsx scripts/channel-probe.ts`).
 *   4. Stop the capture.
 *   5. Signal "HW-048 done" + saved path + the starting channel.
 *      (The script restores the starting channel at the end.)
