/**
 * HW-044 — Read-shape probe for working-buffer state reads.
 *
 * Sends two 0x01 PARAMETER_R/W READ requests (readType=0x0e) and prints
 * every inbound SysEx with a human-readable label. The wire shape of the
 * response is what we need to decode in order to ship `get_block_layout`
 * and `get_param` MCP tools (the conversational-preset MVP needs to read
 * what's currently on the unit before proposing a change).
 *
 * Two reads chosen for cross-validation:
 *   1. pidLow=0x00CE, pidHigh=0x000F — slot-1 block. Response should
 *      carry the current block's pidLow as a parseable float32 at a
 *      fixed offset.
 *   2. pidLow=0x003A, pidHigh=0x000B — amp.gain. Well-known param with
 *      a knob_0_10 scale, easy to sanity-check the decoded value
 *      against the knob position the founder reads on AM4-Edit.
 *
 * Capture procedure (founder-side):
 *   1. Connect AM4 via USB. Close AM4-Edit (it polls and would noise
 *      the capture).
 *   2. Start USBPcap on the AM4's USB endpoint, save to
 *      `samples/captured/session-NN-readprobe.pcapng`.
 *   3. Run `npx tsx scripts/read-probe.ts` (or `npm run read-probe`).
 *   4. Stop the capture. Note on the AM4 display what preset is loaded
 *      and what's actually in slot 1 + the current amp gain knob value.
 *   5. Signal "HW-044 done" + saved path + slot-1 block name + amp gain.
 *
 * See HARDWARE-TASKS.md HW-044 for the full task spec.
