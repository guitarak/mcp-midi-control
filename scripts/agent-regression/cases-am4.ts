  //     then dropped-warn (capability trap), then recovery. Two cascading
  //     traps with one verify-reapply is about 4 calls. If the agent goes

  //     the warning, or the Levenshtein matcher isn't suggesting the
  //     right enum, etc.).
  //   - Structural reverb-type validator (no Hall family) stays:
  //     that's the actual H1 regression check.
  //   - `should_avoid_dropped_param_warning` REMOVED. Dropped warnings
  //     during the recovery sequence are the surface doing its job,
