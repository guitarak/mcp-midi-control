/**
 * Wire-op helpers shared across every AM4 tool that does a SET write:
 * `sendAndAwaitAck` (send + classify ack), `formatAcklessHint` (response
 * fragment when no ack arrives), and the inbound-MIDI capture helpers
 * (`recordInbound` + `formatInboundCapture`) that produce the labelled
 * `[+NNNms] LABEL` timeline appended to every high-value tool response.
 *
 * Diagnostic surface — high-value AM4 tools subscribe to ALL inbound MIDI
 * for the duration of their wire activity, then append a `[+NNNms] LABEL`
 * timeline + one-line ack summary to their response. Helps surface stale-
 * handle / wrong-port / wedged-device situations without requiring a
 * separate `am4_test_navigate` round-trip — when `am4_apply_preset` reports
 * "10 writes, 8 acked" the timeline shows whether the missing 2 writes
 * got NACKs, no response at all, or were absorbed by an unrelated AM4-
 * Edit poll.
 *
 * Mirrors the pattern from Hydra's `hydra_apply_init` /
 * `apply_patch` — same shape, AM4-specific labels via
 * `describeAm4InboundMessage`.

/**

 * echo. Returns:
 *   - { acked: true, ackBytes } if a matching frame arrived in the window.
 *   - { acked: false, captured } otherwise — `captured` is every inbound
 *     SysEx we saw, for diagnostic display on failure.
 * `retried` is set when a cold-start resend was issued (see below).
 *
 * Cold-start resend: a freshly-opened USB-MIDI handle frequently drops the
 * very first outbound transaction during driver warm-up, so the first
 * write's ack can go missing even though the handle is healthy. When the
 * first write on a cold handle (see `isColdHandle`) gets no ack, we resend
 * ONCE on the SAME open handle before giving up. Same-handle (not a
 * close/reopen reconnect) is deliberate: callers that issue several writes
 * in one tool call (the apply executor's batch loop, the rename-then-save
 * sequence) hold this `conn`, and closing the port mid-call would
 * invalidate it. A plain resend recovers the warm-up drop without that
 * hazard; genuinely-dead handles still fall through to the lazy
 * reconnect-after-${STALE_HANDLE_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD}-timeouts backstop.
 * The resend is gated to cold handles so it never fires on the legitimate
 * "block not placed" silent-absorb (a real no-ack that must surface).
 *
 * Calls `recordAckOutcome` once with the final classification so the
 * stale-handle counter stays accurate (a recovered cold start records a
 * single success, not a timeout-then-success).
