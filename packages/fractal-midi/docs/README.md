# `fractal-midi` documentation

Protocol RE, wire-shape decode notes, opcode tables, and Ghidra-mining
infrastructure for the Fractal Audio device family. These docs ship
with the codec because the wire vocabulary IS the codec's domain.
Consumers of `fractal-midi` need them to understand what bytes their
builders/parsers produce.

## Per-device wire maps

| Device | Folder |
|--------|--------|
| AM4 | [`devices/am4/`](devices/am4/) |
| Axe-Fx II XL+ | [`devices/axe-fx-ii/`](devices/axe-fx-ii/) |
| Axe-Fx III | [`devices/axe-fx-iii/`](devices/axe-fx-iii/) |
| Hydrasynth Explorer / KB / DR | [`devices/hydrasynth/`](devices/hydrasynth/) |

Each per-device folder typically contains:

- `README.md`: orientation: what's in this device's wire envelope, decode status, links to related research.
- `SYSEX-MAP.md`: authoritative wire-protocol reference. Envelope, checksum, function bytes, param addressing.
- `manuals/`: vendor PDFs (gitignored) plus extracted `.txt` for grep-ability.
- Research docs (preset-format, state-broadcast, fn-byte decodes, etc.): narrative writeups of how each protocol surface was figured out.

## Cross-device research

[`research/`](research/) holds methodology and status across devices:

- [`ghidra-mining-workflow.md`](research/ghidra-mining-workflow.md): how we extract protocol info from editor binaries.
- [`fractal-broadcast-vs-poll-research.md`](research/fractal-broadcast-vs-poll-research.md): which devices push state vs require polling.
- [`fractal-protocol-decode-status.md`](research/fractal-protocol-decode-status.md): per-device decode status table.

## Capture guides

[`capture-guides/`](capture-guides/): how to collect new captures
when existing ones don't answer a question:

- [`usbpcap-wireshark.md`](capture-guides/usbpcap-wireshark.md): bidirectional USB packet capture on Windows.
- [`juce-binarydata-extraction.md`](capture-guides/juce-binarydata-extraction.md): 5-minute label discovery from JUCE editor binaries.

## Cross-device manuals

[`manuals/`](manuals/): vendor docs that cover MULTIPLE devices:

- `Fractal-Audio-Blocks-Guide.{pdf,txt}`: the canonical block / param reference.
- `Fractal-Audio-Systems-MIMIC-(tm)-Technology.{pdf,txt}`: amp-modeling background.

## Ghidra scripts

[`../scripts/ghidra/`](../scripts/ghidra/) holds the GhidraScripts that
extract param tables, opcode names, dispatch handlers, etc. from each
device's editor binary. Each script has a companion `.cmd` launcher.
Output lands in `samples/captured/decoded/` (gitignored, local-only
research scratch).

## Reading order for a new contributor

1. Pick a device in `devices/<device>/`, read its `README.md`, then
   `SYSEX-MAP.md`.
2. Skim `research/fractal-protocol-decode-status.md` to learn what's
   wire-confirmed (🟢) vs still wiki-only (🟡).
3. If you want to mine new info, read
   `research/ghidra-mining-workflow.md` + try one of the existing
   `scripts/ghidra/*.cmd` launchers against your local Ghidra
   project.

## Audience

These docs target:

1. **`fractal-midi` consumers** writing custom Fractal tooling who
   need to understand the wire shapes the codec hides.
2. **Contributors** extending the codec to new devices or new
   opcodes.
3. **Reverse-engineering hobbyists** documenting Fractal's protocol
   for community benefit.

Not the target audience: end-user musicians (they consume tools built
on this library, not the library itself).
