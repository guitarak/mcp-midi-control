# Byte-literal full SysEx envelope search in Ghidra: does NOT work

A natural Ghidra mining plan for locating an editor's outbound SysEx
emitter is: search the binary for the 5-byte literal of the device's
SysEx envelope (e.g. `F0 00 01 74 10` for Axe-Fx II). It does NOT
work, because the model byte is loaded at runtime from a device-
handle struct, not embedded in the emitter's code.

## Why it fails

The editor's emitter writes the first 4 envelope bytes
(`F0 00 01 74`) as constants and then loads the model byte (`0x10`
for II, `0x07` for III, `0x15` for AM4) from a `*model` field on the
active device-handle struct. In disassembly the emitter looks like:

    F0 00 01 74           ; 4-byte literal
    MOV  AL, [ECX + 0x14] ; load model byte from device handle
    [emit AL]
    ...

The 5-byte search returns zero hits in any Fractal editor. The
4-byte search returns the emitter's literal write plus the model-
load instruction immediately following, which is what identifies
the function. See SESSIONS.md  for the disassembly walk.

## What works instead

- **Search the 4-byte prefix `F0 00 01 74`** and inspect the next
  instruction for the model load. The function is identified by
  the *pair* (literal prefix + model-load), not the full envelope.
- **[[ii-axeedit-opcode-table]]:** once the emitter function is
  identified, mine the static `OpcodeDescriptor` table in `.rdata`
  for the full fn-byte vocabulary (94 entries for II).

## What this does NOT rule out

- Byte-literal search for sub-envelope shapes that are emitted as
  constants (e.g. fn-byte + leading sub-action). Those land in
  `.text` as immediates.
- Searches against AMs / variants whose model byte is also
  hard-coded by an emitter that is not multi-device-capable.
  Editor-side emitters are multi-device; bespoke firmware-side
  emitters may be single-device.

## Refinement history

- 2026-05-22 (cookbook backfill): negative finding registered after
   dispatcher-recovery walk. Pair with the positive
  refinement that Ghidra IS a viable lane for II (`SeekParamTablesII.java`,
  , 1,113 paramId/symbol entries at 99% indexed-symbol
  coverage); see CLAUDE.md "Ghidra-II reversal" note.
