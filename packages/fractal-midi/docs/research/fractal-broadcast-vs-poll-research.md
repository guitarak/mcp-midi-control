# AM4 vs Axe-Fx II, device-broadcast behavior

**Captured 2026-05-11 via `scripts/capture-midi-passive.ts`.**

The two Fractal devices we've decoded have **different protocol
postures** at the device → host broadcast level. This matters for:

- Contributor capture workflow ( evidence shape per device)
- Protocol RE methodology, Axe-Fx II reveals state via passive
  capture; AM4 requires active querying to extract state
- Tool design, `axefx2_*` tools can rely on broadcasts for state
  sync; `am4_*` tools must poll

## Axe-Fx II XL+ (Quantum 8.02): broadcasts continuously

Captured 2026-05-10/11. Passive listening on `AXE-FX II MIDI In`
with no editor connected. Device broadcasts the following without
any host query:

| Function | Count per ~60s capture | Likely role |
|---|---|---|
| `0x10` | ~50 | TEMPO / MIDI clock pulse |
| `0x12` | ~1217 | High-frequency status pulse (PPQN-class) |
| `0x15` | ~768 | Periodic chunked state data (42 bytes each) |
| `0x18` | ~24 | Periodic something |

Plus event broadcasts when the user does something:

| Function | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0x14` | Preset switch (preset-number announcement) |
| `0x29` | Scene switch |
| `0x74/0x75/0x76` triple | Block / param / grid edits via AxeEdit |

**Implication:** the Axe-Fx II is a "state-streaming" device. We
get continuous broadcasts whether anyone's listening or not. A
passive capture of any user activity reveals the device's current
state for free.

## AM4 (Q1.00): silent until queried

Captured 2026-05-11. Passive listening on `AM4 MIDI In` with
AM4-Edit closed, founder changing presets via the front panel
knob. **Zero messages received.** Confirmed with two captures:

- `session-59-am4-idle.syx`, 66.7s of pure idle, **0 messages**
- `session-59-am4-preset-switch.syx`, front-panel preset
  switches over 16.6s, **0 messages**

**Implication:** AM4 has no equivalent of the Axe-Fx II's broadcast
firehose. It only emits MIDI in direct response to host queries.
This is consistent with the original AM4 capture showing
AM4-Edit polling the device ~3,499 times per single-value session
, AM4-Edit polls aggressively *because* the device doesn't
volunteer state.

## Consequences for the project

### Passive-capture script utility (per device)

`scripts/capture-midi-passive.ts` is highly useful for Axe-Fx II
(captures state changes for free, no editor needed). It is **not
useful for AM4 in isolation**: you'd capture zero bytes unless an
editor or host tool is actively querying the device.

For AM4 captures contributors want to use this script, they must
ALSO have AM4-Edit (or our MCP server) running and triggering
queries. The shared-port-read approach works for both Axe-Fx II
and AM4, but on AM4 the "shared" party providing query traffic
must exist.

###  contribution evidence per device

- **Axe-Fx II PRs**: capture is straightforward, passive capture
  alone produces usable evidence files.
- **AM4 PRs**: capture must include the query-issuing party.
  Either:
  - (a) AM4-Edit captures the query+response pair (shared-port-read
    captures the response half).
  - (b) Our MCP server captures both sides (we send the query, we
    log our own outbound + the device's inbound).

Option (b) is the cleanest for, our own goldens hold the
outbound bytes; the response capture provides the third-party-
verifiable inbound bytes. This means **AM4 contributor evidence is
naturally cleaner than Axe-Fx II evidence**: our own encoder
produces the request, the device's response is captured passively,
the goldens verify both halves.

### Tool-design implications

- **Axe-Fx II**: an `axefx2_subscribe_to_state` tool could be
  valuable, open the input port, listen for the device's
  continuous broadcasts, surface state changes to the agent without
  the agent having to poll. Future BK item worth considering.
- **AM4**: same tool would be useless, nothing to subscribe to.
  Polling remains the only way to detect AM4 state changes (e.g.
  the user changed a preset on the device front panel, AM4 won't
  tell us; we have to ask).

### Architectural reflection

This difference probably reflects the products' market positions:

- **Axe-Fx II**: high-end studio/touring unit. State-sync with
  controllers (foot controllers, MFC-101) + editors is critical.
  Continuous broadcasts enable lock-step state.
- **AM4**: compact home/practice unit. MIDI is more of a "configure
  via editor" use case than a "live state sync" use case. The
  protocol cost of broadcasts isn't justified by the market need.

Worth keeping in mind when speculating about what Axe-Fx III /
FM3 / FM9 might do, those are higher-end again than the II, so
likely have at least as much broadcast as the II, possibly more.
