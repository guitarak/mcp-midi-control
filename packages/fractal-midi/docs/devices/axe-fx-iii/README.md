# Axe-Fx III: protocol + research

Fractal Axe-Fx III (model byte `0x10`). Community-beta; the project
maintainer doesn't own a III, so wire shapes are decoded from the
Fractal v1.4 PDF plus public captures and Ghidra mining of AxeEdit III.
Code lives in [`src/axe-fx-iii/`](../../../src/axe-fx-iii/) (codec) and the consumer MCP descriptors at [`packages/axe-fx-iii/` in the consumer repo](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/mcp-midi-control/tree/main/packages/axe-fx-iii).

## Files in this directory

- [`SYSEX-MAP.md`](./SYSEX-MAP.md): Axe-Fx III wire-protocol reference.
  Covers the v1.4 PDF (10 documented functions) + 21 fn bytes confirmed
  via Ghidra caller trace + the 49-effect dispatcher catalog. **`§0x01
  PARAMETER_SETGET`** is byte-verified against 10 public captures.
- [`design-notes.md`](./design-notes.md): design notes captured while
  scaffolding the III package. Some predate later decode work; cite
  carefully.
- [`dirty-state-research.md`](./dirty-state-research.md): evidence
  chain for the III's `04 01` STATE_BROADCAST dirty signal.
- [`fn01-decode.md`](./fn01-decode.md): function `0x01` three-mode
  envelope decode.
- [`preset-format-research.md`](./preset-format-research.md):
  community RE of the III preset-save format (forum thread #159885
  archive).
- [`set-parameter-captures.md`](./set-parameter-captures.md): the 10
  public captures that locked the `fn=0x01` SET_PARAMETER envelope.
