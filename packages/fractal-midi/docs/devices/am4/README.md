# AM4: protocol + research

Fractal AM4 is the project's headline device, the deepest protocol
RE, the most hardware-verified, and the reference shape every other
device follows. Code lives in [`src/am4/`](../../../src/am4/) (codec) and the consumer MCP descriptors at [`packages/am4/` in the consumer repo](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/mcp-midi-control/tree/main/packages/am4).

## Files in this directory

- [`SYSEX-MAP.md`](./SYSEX-MAP.md): authoritative AM4 wire-protocol
  reference. Envelope, checksum, function bytes, param addressing,
  per-block decodes, all with capture citations.
- [`0x01-stream-research.md`](./0x01-stream-research.md): research on
  the undocumented `0x01` editor-stream function used by AM4-Edit.
- [`preset-binary-format-research.md`](./preset-binary-format-research.md):
  research on the preset binary format (Huffman-compressed chunks).
- [`preset-dump-request-research.md`](./preset-dump-request-research.md):
  host -> device dump-request envelope decode.
- [`preset-read-research.md`](./preset-read-research.md):
  non-destructive stored-preset name reads (action `0x0012`).
- [`factory-restore-research.md`](./factory-restore-research.md):
  factory bank file structure and replay-to-restore mechanism.
