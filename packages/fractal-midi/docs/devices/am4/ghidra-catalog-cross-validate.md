## Per-block coverage table

Maps shipped catalog block names to Ghidra effect-family tables.
Gap is `(sum of mapped families' entries) - (catalog entries)`.
Positive = Ghidra has entries the catalog lacks; negative = catalog
has extras (typically CACHE_PARAMS mirrors and type-conditional
duplicates the Ghidra dump doesn't enumerate separately).

## Reading the gaps

### Negative gaps (catalog > Ghidra)

Catalog has more rows than the Ghidra dump for chorus, compressor,
enhancer, filter, flanger, gate, geq, ingate, peq, phaser, preset,
rotary, tremolo, volpan, wah. Reason: the catalog includes
**CACHE_PARAMS mirrors** (the same paramId registered with multiple
display names / per-type calibrations) plus **type-conditional
entries** that the Ghidra dump enumerates only once per descriptor
table. Not a real coverage problem, these are catalog-side
duplicates by design.

### Small positive gaps (1-16)

`amp +4`, `drive +16`, `global +1`, likely a handful of unregistered
params per block. Worth a focused per-block audit (~30 min each)
against the Ghidra symbol names to surface any genuinely missing
knobs. Drive's +16 includes the FUZZ-and-DYNDIST families that may
be AM4-exposed type variants the catalog hasn't enumerated.

### Large positive gaps, the real surface area

**`delay +182`**: AM4 has multiple delay block-type variants
(standard DELAY, MEGATAP, TENTAP, MULTITAP) each with its own param
table. The catalog's `delay.*` namespace stores params for all types
but with type-applicability gates; the gap suggests many MEGATAP /
TENTAP / MULTITAP-specific params are not registered. High-yield
audit target.

**`reverb +82`**: Standard REVERB (63) is fully covered by the
catalog's 68 entries. PLEX (87): the AM4's Plex Reverb type, is
mostly un-registered. PLEX is a real AM4 user-facing reverb variant
(visible in AM4-Edit's reverb-type dropdown), so these entries are
genuine missing catalog coverage. High-yield audit target.

## Unmapped Ghidra families (potential AM4 blocks OR multi-product artifacts)

AM4-Edit is a multi-product editor binary (per cookbook
`[[iii-multiproduct-editor-binary]]`, model-byte dispatch over
III/FM9/FM3/AM4 was confirmed in the third-hop decode of
`FUN_1401da990`). Some Ghidra families correspond to features the
AM4 firmware doesn't expose; the binary carries the code for shared
multi-product handling. Without firmware verification, we can only
classify by confidence tier.

| Ghidra family | Entries | AM4 likelihood            | Reason                                                                 |

## High-leverage audit candidates (no hardware needed)

These can be closed mechanically by reading the Ghidra dump and
adding entries to `KNOWN_PARAMS` for symbols the catalog lacks:

1. **PLEX reverb expansion** (~80 entries): add PLEX-specific
   reverb params under the existing `reverb.*` namespace with
   type-applicability gates for the Plex Reverb block type.
2. **Delay variants expansion** (~180 entries combined): register
   MEGATAP, TENTAP, MULTITAP params under `delay.*` with type
   gates. Bulk of the delay variant coverage.
3. **Drive variants** (~16 entries): audit FUZZ + DYNDIST symbols
   against the existing `drive.*` registrations.

## High-leverage audit candidates (hardware verification needed)

These require placing the candidate block in a slot on hardware
and observing whether the AM4 front panel reflects it:

4. **MIDIBLOCK** (5 entries): almost certainly AM4-exposed
   (Scene-MIDI work). Wire the 5 entries into `global.*`
   or a new `midiblock.*` namespace per founder preference.
5. **RINGMOD / FORMANT / IRCAPTURE** (~14 entries combined):    verify by checking AM4-Edit's block-type dropdown. If they
   appear, register; if not, they're multi-product artifacts.

## Low-leverage (skip or defer)

VOCODER, SYNTH, LOOPER, TONEMATCH, RTA, almost certainly
multi-product artifacts not exposed by AM4 firmware. Skip until
proven otherwise.

## Production code impact

None right now. This is a backlog-grooming document that maps the
high-leverage audit candidates so future sessions can pick them up
mechanically. The shipped catalog is functionally complete for
every block the AM4 actually exposes in practice; the gaps are
incremental coverage improvements (PLEX reverb params, delay
variants), not correctness bugs.

The single correctness bug surfaced this session (filter +
enhancer pan_left/right bipolar encoding) was fixed in the same
session, see STATE-AM4 follow-up #1.

## Regeneration

To re-run the cross-validate after a Ghidra re-mine or a catalog
update:

```bash
node -e "
const am4 = require('packages/fractal-midi/dist/am4/params.js');
const ghidra = require('SAMPLES/decoded/ghidra-am4edit-paramtables.json');
// ... per-block coverage diff (see scripts/_research/ if landed)
"
```

A reusable script lives at (not yet written, drop in
`scripts/_research/ghidra-am4-catalog-crossref.ts` when needed).
