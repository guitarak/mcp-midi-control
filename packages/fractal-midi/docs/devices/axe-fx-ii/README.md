# Axe-Fx II: protocol + research

Fractal Axe-Fx II XL+ (model byte `0x07`). Hardware-verified on Quantum
8.02. Code lives in [`src/gen2/axe-fx-ii/`](../../../src/gen2/axe-fx-ii/) (codec) and the consumer MCP descriptors at [`packages/fractal-gen2/` in the consumer repo](https://github.com/TheAndrewStaker/mcp-midi-control/tree/main/packages/fractal-gen2).

## Files in this directory

- [`SYSEX-MAP.md`](./SYSEX-MAP.md): Axe-Fx II wire-protocol reference.
  Family overview (model bytes 0x03 / 0x06 / 0x07 / 0x08), envelope,
  documented + undocumented function bytes, captured decodes.
- [`community-re-methodology.md`](./community-re-methodology.md):
  a survey of public open-source Axe-Fx II RE projects, with license,
  staleness, and coverage notes. Background for the "build informed by,
  not depend on" decision.
- [`component-catalog.md`](./component-catalog.md): auto-generated
  catalog of Axe-Edit's `<EditorControl>` entries (block types,
  parameters, variant + page structure, applicability gates).
  Re-generate via `scripts/extract-axe-fx-ii-catalog.ts`.
- [`state-broadcast-decode-research.md`](./state-broadcast-decode-research.md):
  decode of the `0x74` / `0x75` / `0x76` state-broadcast triple
  (read-side; hardware-confirmed not bidirectional).

- [`../am4/SYSEX-MAP.md`](../am4/SYSEX-MAP.md): many AM4 findings
  transfer to Axe-Fx II since both share the envelope + checksum.

  current decode coverage across all Fractal devices.
