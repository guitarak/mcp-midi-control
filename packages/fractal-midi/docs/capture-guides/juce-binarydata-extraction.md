## Why this matters

Many vendor-supplied audio hardware editors ship as compiled binaries
with their UI configuration, parameter labels, layouts, and assets
embedded directly in the executable. Reverse-engineering a closed
editor's protocol typically means USBPcap captures, debugger
breakpoints, and code analysis, days to weeks per device.

For editors built on the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework, almost
all of that work is unnecessary. Projucer (JUCE's project generator)
bundles non-code assets via its **BinaryData** system, and a common
configuration packs them into a single ZIP archive embedded in the
binary's read-only data section.

That ZIP is a normal ZIP. You can extract it with `unzip` once you
locate it. The five-minute path:

1. Confirm the editor is JUCE-based.
2. Search the binary for the ZIP End-of-Central-Directory signature.
3. Slice and extract.
4. Read the layout XML files to map symbolic IDs to display labels.

If the editor isn't JUCE, this guide doesn't apply, fall back to
USBPcap + debugger workflows.

## Step 1: Is the editor JUCE-based?

Three reliable signals, any one is sufficient:

**A. Linked DirectX/DirectWrite stack on Windows.** JUCE's standard
Windows backend uses Direct2D + DirectWrite + DirectX 11. Run:

```powershell
# Replace EXE_PATH with the editor's path
& 'C:\Windows\System32\tasklist.exe' /M /FI "IMAGENAME eq <editor>.exe"
```

After launching the editor. If you see `dwrite.dll`, `d2d1.dll`,
`d3d11.dll` loaded together, that's a strong JUCE signal. Classic
GDI / GDI+ / Uniscribe alone is not.

**B. `juce::` symbols in the binary.** Even with stripped builds,
JUCE's `vftable` symbols, RTTI-derived class names, and assertion
strings often survive:

```bash
strings <editor>.exe | grep -i 'juce::' | head
```

A handful of hits is enough.

**C. Recognisable BinaryData filenames.** JUCE's Projucer prefixes
embedded resource names with `__` so they're valid C++ identifiers.
Search the binary for distinctive `__*.xml` / `__*.svg` strings:

```bash
strings <editor>.exe | grep -E '^__[a-z_]+\.(xml|svg|png|ttf|otf)$' | head
```

If you see filenames that look like project assets (`__layouts.xml`,
`__skin.xml`, `__icons.svg`), JUCE BinaryData is in play.

## Step 2: Locate the embedded ZIP

JUCE's BinaryData with the "Compress files" option enabled produces
a single ZIP archive concatenated into `.rdata`. Find it by searching
backward from end-of-file for the ZIP End-of-Central-Directory (EOCD)
signature `50 4B 05 06`:

```typescript
// Pseudocode:
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
const buf = readFileSync(EXE);
// EOCD is in the LAST 22+commentLen bytes; scan backward.
let eocdOff = -1;
for (let i = buf.length - 22; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (buf[i] === 0x50 && buf[i+1] === 0x4b &&
        buf[i+2] === 0x05 && buf[i+3] === 0x06) { eocdOff = i; break; }
}
const cdSize        = buf.readUInt32LE(eocdOff + 12);
const cdOffsetInZip = buf.readUInt32LE(eocdOff + 16);
const commentLen    = buf.readUInt16LE(eocdOff + 20);
// EOCD points at the central directory; central directory is
// preceded by all local file headers + their compressed data.
const zipStart = eocdOff - cdSize - cdOffsetInZip;
const zipEnd   = eocdOff + 22 + commentLen;
const zipBytes = buf.subarray(zipStart, zipEnd);
```

The slice `[zipStart, zipEnd)` is a valid ZIP archive. Write it to
disk and extract with any standard ZIP tool.

## Step 3: Extract

```bash
unzip <extracted>.zip -d ./resources/
ls resources/
```

A typical JUCE editor's BinaryData ZIP contains:

| File pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__*.xml` | Layout / parameter / control configuration |
| `*.svg` | UI icons and skins |
| `*.png` | Bitmap assets |
| `*.ttf` / `*.otf` | Embedded fonts |
| `Release-Notes.txt` (or similar) | Build metadata |

The XML files are the prize for protocol RE, they typically map
**symbolic parameter IDs** (the keys the binary uses internally) to
**display labels** (what the user sees on screen).

## Step 4: Map symbolic IDs to display labels

Open the XML files in a text editor or grep them. Look for entries
like:

```xml
<EditorControl name="Bright Cap" parameterName="DISTORT_BRIGHTCAP" type="knob"/>
```

Or in older JUCE conventions:

```xml
<EffectParameter id="DISTORT_BRIGHTCAP" name="Bright Cap"/>
```

The `parameterName` / `id` is the symbolic key used in the editor's
code and (often) on the wire. The `name` is the AM4-Edit-style
display label. Together they're a 100% accurate display-label
mapping, scoped to the firmware version that produced the binary.

For a project supporting agent control of the device, this means:
- Tool descriptions can use the exact word the user reads on screen.
- Parameter discovery is a one-shot extraction, not a
  capture-per-knob investigation.

## Step 5 (gotchas)

**The ZIP isn't always present.** Projucer's BinaryData has a
"Compress files" option that emits a ZIP; without it, individual
resources are inlined as raw byte arrays in `.rdata`. If
`PK\x05\x06` doesn't appear, search for individual `__*.xml`
strings and follow xref patterns to find the data instead.

**Multiple concatenated ZIPs.** Some binaries embed *more than
one* ZIP archive, for example, the editor's own layout/asset
ZIP plus a separately-bundled updater UI (Fractal's binaries
ship a Fractal-Bot ZIP alongside the editor's main ZIP). The
backward `PK\x05\x06` search finds only the LAST one, which may
be the wrong one. Two consequences:

  - For a SINGLE-ZIP binary like AM4-Edit, the last EOCD is the
    only EOCD and points at the editor's main bundle (which in
    AM4-Edit happens to also include the Fractal-Bot resources
    concatenated in one ZIP).
  - For a MULTI-ZIP binary like Axe-Edit III, the last EOCD
    points at the small Fractal-Bot-only ZIP (~700 KB, 58
    entries); the layout XMLs we want are in an EARLIER ZIP at
    a different EOCD (~8.5 MB, 398 entries, including a 1.3 MB
    `__block_layout.xml`).

**Detection:** if the last EOCD points at a ZIP that doesn't
contain the layout XMLs you expect, scan the entire binary for
all `PK\x05\x06` candidates and try each one. Most random byte
sequences that happen to match `PK\x05\x06` will have nonsense
EOCD fields (entries=65535, multi-GB sizes); a quick
plausibility check rules them out. The `scripts/extract-all-zips.ts`
script in this repo does exactly this: scans, validates, and
extracts every valid ZIP it finds.

**Some BinaryData uses gzip per-file rather than a single ZIP.**
Look for `1F 8B 08` (gzip member signature). Decompress per-file.

**Some editors store XML uncompressed but tokenised** (parsed
into a custom binary form by a custom XML preprocessor). Rare
but documented; falls back to the harder static analysis path.

**Versioned overlay XMLs.** For amps (and possibly other blocks),
Fractal ships firmware-version-specific layout overlays:
`__amp_layout_v24p00.xml`, `__amp_layout_v24p05.xml`,
`__amp_layout_v28p09.xml`, etc. The base `__amp_layout.xml`
covers the canonical layout; the `_vXXpYY` files are deltas
for when the firmware shifts amp-block parameters between
versions. When extracting and parsing for a multi-firmware
device, prefer the most recent `_vXXpYY` overlay AND the base
file together, they're a clean diff source and fit
straightforwardly into firmware-reconciliation workflows.

## What this DOESN'T give you

- **Wire IDs (`pidLow` / `pidHigh`).** The XML knows the symbolic
  ID and the label. The wire ID, the bytes that go on the
  USB/MIDI cable to actually change the parameter, usually lives
  in a separate metadata file, in the device's firmware, or in
  the editor's compiled code. Captures are still required for
  this layer.
- **Value encoding (Q15, packed-float, septet packing).** The
  editor decodes wire values into display values via code, not
  data. Captures + structural analysis remain necessary.
- **Behavioural relationships** (which params depend on which,
  which knobs are gated by which type selector). Sometimes
  encoded in the XML's `controllingParamName` attributes;
  often in code.

So this technique gets you 30-40% of the device-onboarding work
for free, on day one. The rest of the protocol still needs the
classic captures + cache parsing + decode workflows. But the
**labelling** problem, which had been the hardest part of the
multi-device story for closed editors, is now a five-minute fix
per JUCE-based editor.

## AM4 worked example

**Target:** `C:\Program Files\Fractal Audio\AM4-Edit\AM4-Edit.exe`
(20.7 MB, build dated `Mar 20 2026 06:46:54`).

**Verification (Step 1):**
- DirectWrite + Direct2D + DirectX 11 confirmed loaded at runtime.
- `juce::MemoryInputStream::vftable` directly referenced from the
  loader caller `FUN_14031fed0` (Ghidra trace via
  `scripts/ghidra/TraceLoaderCallers.java`).
- `__components.xml`, `__block_layout.xml`,
  `__block_layout_expert.xml` filename strings present in the
  binary.

**Locate the ZIP (Step 2):**

EOCD `PK\x05\x06` found at file offset `0x7DFF26`. Header values:
- entries = 58 (in the EOCD record)
- cdSize = `0x1618`
- cdOffsetInZip = `0xA8D6E`

Computed `zipStart = 0x7DFF26 - 0x1618 - 0xA8D6E = 0x735BA0`. The
ZIP spans file `0x735BA0..0x7DFF40`, about 270 KB.

**Extract (Step 3):**

`scripts/extract-juce-resources-zip.ts` automates this. Output:
350 entries, three XML files (~1.5 MB uncompressed total) plus
347 SVG/PNG/font/audio assets.

**Map symbolic IDs (Step 4):**

`scripts/parse-am4edit-labels.ts` walks all three XMLs, tracks
parent-element context (`EditorControls > EffectVariants >
EffectVariant > Page > Parameters > Row > EditorControl`), and
emits `src/protocol/editorControlLabels.ts` with 1,299 unique
parameterNames and their canonical AM4-Edit display labels.

Spot-check confirms the previously-elusive labels are all
present:

| parameterName | canonicalLabel |
|---|---|
| `DISTORT_BRIGHTCAP` | Bright Cap |
| `DISTORT_HITREBLE` | High Treble |
| `DISTORT_SATDRIVE` | Saturation Drive |
| `DISTORT_MVTRIM` | Master Vol Trim |
| `DISTORT_BETA` | Negative Feedback |
| `COMP_KNEE` | Knee Type |
| `COMP_SIDECHAIN` | Sidechain Source |
| `FUZZ_SLEW` | Slew Rate |
| `FLANGER_FOCUS` | Bass Focus |

**Context-dependent labelling worked too:** `DISTORT_TREBLE`
shows as "Treble" on standard amps but "Tone" on simpler tone-
stack amps; `GEQ_GAIN3` shows as the actual Hz centre frequency
("125", "320", "400") which differs across GraphicEQ types. Both
captured in the `contexts[]` array per parameterName.

**Total time from start to extracted labels:** ~10 minutes,
including writing the script. The seven sessions of capture-driven
RE that preceded this finding (Frida, WinDbg, Ghidra, memory
dumps) were not strictly required for label extraction. They
remain load-bearing for protocol decode (wire IDs, value
encoding) but not for the labelling layer.

## Future devices to try this on

| Device | Editor | Likely JUCE? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| AM4 | AM4-Edit | ✓ JUCE | **Validated 2026-05-03**: 1,299 parameterNames extracted |
| Axe-Fx III / FM9 / FM3 / VP4 | Axe-Edit III | ✓ JUCE | **Validated 2026-05-03**: `__block_layout.xml` 1.3 MB, 10,250 EditorControl matches; same XML format as AM4 |
| Axe-Fx II XL+ | Axe-Edit II | Probably | Probe |
| Boss RC-505 MKII / VE-500 | Boss Tone Studio | Unknown | Probe |
| Line 6 Helix / HX Stomp | Helix Native, HX Edit | Unknown | Probe |
| Quad Cortex | NDSP Cortex Cloud | Unknown, desktop editor exists | Probe |
| Third-party Fractal editor (closed-source community tool) | (closed) | Worth probing | Probe |

For each: run `scripts/probe-juce-binarydata.ts <exe>` first to
detect the ZIP. If found, run `scripts/extract-all-zips.ts <exe>`
to slice every valid ZIP out (multi-EOCD aware). Inspect the
resulting XML files for `<EditorControl>` entries. Result should
be a near-complete display-label catalogue for the device, ready
to wire into a per-device protocol package per the multi-repo
architecture (`memory/project_multi_repo_architecture.md`).
