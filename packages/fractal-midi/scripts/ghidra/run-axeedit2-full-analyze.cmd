REM Run a full Ghidra Auto-Analyze pass on the II-generation Axe-Edit.exe
REM with all data-reference analyzers enabled. The default project import
REM omits some data-ref analyzers on 32-bit binaries, leaving the param
REM resolver's xrefs empty — Session 83's first MineAxeEditIIParamResolver
REM run found only 3 callers as a result. Run THIS once, then re-run
REM `run-axeedit2-paramresolver.cmd` to mine the dispatcher.

REM Wall time: ~20-40 min on a typical laptop. Safe to run in background.
REM Re-running is idempotent — Ghidra detects already-analyzed bytes and
REM only re-runs analyzers that weren't applied first time around.
