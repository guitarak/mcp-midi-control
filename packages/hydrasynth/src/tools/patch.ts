  description: `Build a Hydrasynth patch atomically: apply a sparse override map (or recipe_id) on top of the factory INIT buffer and dump via SysEx to the named slot. Covers the full surface (oscillators, filters, envelopes, mixer, mutators, pre/post-FX, delay, reverb, name) in ONE call; no follow-up NRPN batch needed.
VALUES ARE DISPLAY UNITS (same pipeline as set_param); never pass raw wire numbers. Percent params (delaywet, reverbwet, prefxwet, postfxwet, mutator*wet/feedback) take 0..100. ENV/LFO TIME params take panel time as a number in ms (250) or string ("2.5s"/"250ms"): covers env*{attack,decay,release,hold,delay}syncoff + lfo*delaysyncoff (env*sustain is a 0..128 LEVEL, not a time). LFO free-run rate (lfo*ratesyncoff) takes Hz (4.44 or "4.44 Hz", 0.02..150); reverbtime takes seconds (2.6/"2.6s"/"250ms" or "Freeze"). The codec inverts each non-linear table internally: pass the panel reading, never a raw index.
TIME HINTS: slow pad attack ~1500-3000ms / decay ~600ms / release ~2000-8000ms; snappy bass attack 0-5ms / decay 30-200ms / release 30-150ms.
TEMPO-SYNC: sync-on params are musical-division enum STRINGS ("1/4","1/4 D","1/8","1/16"...): delaytimesyncon, lfo*ratesyncon, env*{...}syncon. Pair the sync flag (delaybpmsync:1 / lfo*bpmsync:1) with the matching syncon division, both in one call. For rhythmic music (ambient, Edge/U2, post-rock) prefer delaybpmsync:1 + delaytimesyncon; use delaybpmsync:0 + delaytimesyncoff (raw ms) only for free-time/slapback. voicevibratoratesyncoff is still a raw 0..127 index.
FX SUB-PARAMS ARE TYPE-DEPENDENT: prefxparam1..5 / postfxparam1..5 mean different things per prefxtype / postfxtype. Set an FX type and the encoder auto-fills that type's audible defaults; pass param1..5 to shape it. Mappings (1..5):
  Lo-Fi: Cutoff Hz, Resonance, Filter Type ("Thru"/"PWBass"/"Radio"/"Tele"/"Clean"/"Low"), Output dB makeup, Sampling Hz.
  Chorus/Flanger: Rate Hz, Depth, Offset (-180..180), Feedback (-63..63), Mono/Stereo.
  Phaser: Rate, Feedback, Depth, Phase, Offset.  Rotary: Rate, LFO, Lo-Depth, Hi-Depth, Low/High mix.
  Tremolo: Rate, Depth, LFO Shape ("Sine"/"Square"), Phase, Pitch Mod.  EQ: Low Gain dB, High Gain dB, Mid Gain dB, Xover Low Hz, Xover High Hz.
  Compressor: Threshold, Ratio (1.0..20.0), Attack ms, Release ms, Output dB.  Distortion: Drive, Tone, Asym, Curve, Output dB.
GAIN STAGING for quiet patches (flow: osc->mixer->filter->amp->prefx->delay/reverb->postfx->master): push amplevel to 120-128; raise mixerosc{1,2,3}vol (INIT has osc2/osc3 at 0). Lo-Fi prefxparam4 is makeup gain; prefxparam1 is Cutoff Hz downstream of the filter, so set it ABOVE the highest played note (C4=262Hz, C5=523Hz) or signal dies.
