/**
 * Hydrasynth Explorer — MIDI connection helper.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of `src/protocol/midi.ts` (the AM4 connection
 * helper) but device-scoped: looks for "hydrasynth" / "asm hydra" in
 * port names, opens both an Output and an Input.
 *
 * Why the Input port matters: NRPN/CC writes are fire-and-forget on
 * the Hydrasynth (`docs/devices/hydrasynth-explorer/FIRST-SMOKE.md`
 * §3 — "The Hydrasynth does not ack CCs"). But SysEx is a *different*
 * protocol path that DOES emit acks per `SysexEncoding.txt` (lines
 * 342, 351-352, 377-378): `19 00` after Header `18 00`, `17 00 NN 16`
 * after every chunk, `1B 00` after Footer `1A 00`, and `07 00 BANK
 * PATCH` "Patch Saved" after the final chunk. Opening Input lets
 * `hydra_apply_init` observe these to diagnose silent-on-key-press
 * failure modes (HW-040 test 1).
 *
 * The Input port is best-effort — if the OS doesn't expose a
 * Hydrasynth input (some USB-MIDI driver configurations expose only
 * output), we fall back to output-only and `hasInput` flips false.
 * NRPN/CC tools keep working; only SysEx diagnostics lose visibility.
