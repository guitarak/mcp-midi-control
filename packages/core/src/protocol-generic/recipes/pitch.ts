/**
 * Pitch block recipe library (BK-061).
 *
 * Hardcoded library of named pitch-block configurations the agent can
 * apply by intent instead of authoring params from scratch. Each recipe
 * is a static display-value dict per device, keyed by the device's
 * native param names (e.g. II's `voice_1_shift`, III's `PITCH_SHIFT1`).
 * Pure data + lookup. No wire encoding, no tool registration.
 *
 * Display-first convention (per CLAUDE.md "Tool API conventions"):
 *   Numbers are display units. Semitone shifts in semitones, detunes
 *   in cents, mix in 0..100 percent. The downstream `apply_preset`
 *   executor is responsible for display->wire conversion.
 *
 * Device coverage:
 *   - Axe-Fx II  : full coverage. Catalog at fractal-midi/gen2/axe-fx-ii
 *     KNOWN_PARAMS `pitch.*` (voice_1_shift, voice_2_shift,
 *     voice_1_detune, voice_2_detune, mix, voice_1_level,
 *     voice_2_level, control).
 *   - Axe-Fx III : full coverage. Catalog at fractal-midi/gen3/axe-fx-iii
 *     PARAMS family=PITCH (PITCH_SHIFT1, PITCH_SHIFT2, PITCH_DETUNE1,
 *     PITCH_DETUNE2, PITCH_MIX, PITCH_LEVEL1, PITCH_LEVEL2,
 *     PITCH_CTRL).
 *   - AM4        : not applicable. AM4 has no standalone pitch block
 *     (reverb has a pitch-mix knob but that is not a pitch block).
 *     `applicable_devices` omits 'am4' on every recipe.
 *
 * Recipe value provenance:
 *   Octave shifts (+/-12, +/-7, +/-3) and detune cents are universal
 *   pitch-shifter conventions; no Fractal-specific source needed. Mix
 *   ratios are 50/50 for octave-up (classic blend), 30/70 dry-heavy
 *   for octave-down (avoids muddiness, common forum advice on Fractal
 *   forum pitch-block threads), 40/60 for harmonies (lead/harmony
 *   balance), 35/65 for power-chord stacks (root dominant).
 *
 * The whammy_expression recipe is marked `modifier_needed: true` —
 * BK-063 (modifier system decode) hasn't landed yet, so an agent that
 * applies this recipe gets the base PITCH_CTRL=0 starting position
 * but the user (or BK-063 follow-on) still needs to wire an
 * expression-pedal modifier onto pitch.control / PITCH_CTRL.
