/**
 * BK-064 part 2: scene-leveling recipe library.
 *
 * Named recipes that describe a per-scene dB offset profile keyed by
 * scene-role (clean / rhythm / build / solo / breakdown / intro).
 * Apply by writing the recipe's dB offset to the Output 1 block's
 * level knob on each scene, tone-preserving — the amp/drive/cab
 * voicing stays put; only the master output level shifts per scene.
 *
 * Why Output-block offsets, not amp masters: amp master changes the
 * tone (push the tubes harder = different distortion character).
 * Output 1 block changes only the post-effects level, so the scenes
 * sound like louder/quieter versions of the same preset rather than
 * different tones. This is the canonical "scene leveling for
 * dynamics" approach Fractal players use.
 *
 * Source of truth: docs/_private/04-BACKLOG.md BK-064 sub-deliverable
 * 2. Profile values were authored from the BACKLOG's reference table:
 *
 *   arrangement_dynamic_rock — clean -6, rhythm 0, build -2, solo +3, breakdown -8
 *   arrangement_balanced_metal — intro -4, rhythm 0, solo +3, breakdown -3
 *   arrangement_loud_solo — rhythm 0, solo +5  (Metallica / lead-on-top mix)
 *   arrangement_modern_mix — rhythm 0, solo +2 (modern mix, solos sit in)
 *
 * Application:
 *   The recipe table is pure data. To apply, the agent maps each
 *   scene index to a scene-role (the agent decides which scene is
 *   "rhythm" vs "solo" — the recipe is intent-keyed, not scene-
 *   indexed) and writes the matching dB offset to the Output 1
 *   block's level knob via `set_param` after switching to that
 *   scene, OR via per-scene Output 1 channel params if the device
 *   supports it.
 *
 * Pure data. No I/O. Cross-device by construction — dB offsets are
 * device-agnostic; the Output 1 block exists on every Fractal
 * device, and Hydrasynth has VOICE_AMP_VOLUME for the analogous role.

 * Output 1 levels are addressed:
 *
 *   AM4: no separate Output block; use the Volume block (`volpan`)
 *     `volume` param. AM4 has 4 scenes, so the recipe can map up to
 *     4 of the 6 roles.
 *
 *   Axe-Fx II / III: dedicated Output 1 block. Most direct path is
 *     per-scene level (II: scene levels live in OUT1_LEVEL_SCENE_N;
 *     III: same with the corresponding III param). 8 scenes available.
 *
 *   Hydrasynth: no scenes. The agent can still use the recipe's role
 *     dB offsets to bake them into snapshots (Hydra "patches"), but
 *     this is informational rather than directly applicable.
